BUSINESS\nOVERVIEW\nAt PayPal Holdings, Inc., our mission is to revolutionize commerce globally. Our products are designed to enable digital payments and simplify commerce experiences for consumers and merchants to make selling, shopping, and sending and receiving money simple, personalized, and secure, online or offline, including mobile. Our two-sided platform serves millions of consumers and merchants worldwide.\nWe help consumers transact quickly and securely with merchants, manage their financial lives, and send to and receive money from friends and family around the globe. We provide consumers with a digital wallet that enables them to send payments to merchants securely using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, our consumer credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible rewards.\nWe help merchants connect with customers, increase conversion rates and sales, and grow their businesses in the markets where our services are available. We provide large enterprises and small and medium businesses with online branded checkout solutions, including PayPal and Venmo; online unbranded payments processing, including Braintree and PayPal Complete Payments; our buy now, pay later solutions, which we refer to as PayPal Pay Later; in-person point of sale systems, including Zettle; business financing, including PayPal Working Capital (\u201cPPWC\u201d) and PayPal Business Loan (\u201cPPBL\u201d); payouts capabilities; and risk tools.\nWe operate a global, two-sided network at scale that connects consumers and merchants with 434 million active accounts across approximately 200 markets as of December\u00a031, 2024.\nWe earn revenues primarily by charging fees for completing payment transactions for our customers and other payment-related services, which are typically based on the volume of activity processed on our payments platform. We also generate revenue from customers for currency conversion, for instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, and to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; however, we generally do not charge customers to fund or draw from their accounts. We also earn revenue by providing other value added services, which primarily comprise revenue earned through partnerships, interest and fees from our consumer and merchant credit products, interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances, referral fees, subscription fees, and gateway services.\nUnless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d or \u201cPayPal\u201d refer to PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n4\nTable of Contents\nKEY PERFORMANCE METRICS\nIn 2024, we processed $1.68 trillion of total payment volume (\u201cTPV\u201d), an increase of 10% compared to 2023, and 26.3 billion payment transactions, an increase of 5% compared to 2023. As of December\u00a031, 2024, we had 434 million active accounts, an increase of 2% compared to December\u00a031, 2023.\nWe measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers through certain metrics, including TPV, payment transactions, and active accounts:\nTPV\nis the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\nNumber of payment transactions\nis the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\nAn\nactive account\nis an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal\u2019s platform or services through such third-party\u2019s login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet\u2019s payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results.\nOUR STRENGTHS\nOur business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive profitable growth and differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:\n\u2022\nTwo-sided platform\n\u2014\nwe facilitate online and offline transactions for millions of consumers and merchants. Our relationship on both sides of a transaction enables us to offer unique product experiences designed to remove friction, drive sales, and enhance shopping experiences. We utilize the data about how our customers use our platform to continually innovate and improve it.\n\u2022\nTrusted brands\n\u2014\nwe have built and strengthened well-recognized and trusted brands, including PayPal, Venmo, and Braintree. Our communications and marketing efforts across multiple geographies and demographic groups play an important role in building brand visibility, usage, and overall preference among customers.\n\u2022\nOpen ecosystem\n\u2014\nwe are technology and platform agnostic. This approach allows our merchants to offer and use a variety of our branded and unbranded payment processing solutions and business financing products, alongside other tools. We give consumers flexibility to make and receive payments using a wide variety of funding options and digital wallet solutions, including their bank account, PayPal and Venmo account balance, buy now, pay later, debit and credit options.\n\u2022\nScale\n\u2014\nour global scale helps us to drive organic growth. As of December\u00a031, 2024, we had 434 million active accounts in approximately 200 markets\n1\naround the world.\n\u2022\nRisk and compliance management\n\u2014\nour enterprise risk and compliance management program is designed to help keep customer information secure and ensure we process legitimate transactions around the world, while identifying and minimizing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions.\n\u2022\nRegulatory licenses\n\u2014\nwe believe that our regulatory licenses, which enable us to operate in markets around the world, are a distinct advantage and help support business growth.\n1\nA market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate, in which we offer some or all of our products and services. A country, territory, or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations.\n5\nTable of Contents\nCONSUMER AND MERCHANT PAYMENT SOLUTIONS\nConsumer value proposition\nWe help consumers transact securely with merchants, manage their financial lives, and send to and receive money from friends and family around the globe. Our goal is to create the simplest checkout experience possible for consumers online or offline, including mobile. We drive increased consumer engagement by providing consumers with a wide range of services to manage their finances and enhance their ability to shop online and offline. Our PayPal and Venmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. We also focus on simplifying and personalizing shopping experiences for our consumers by offering tools for product discovery, price tracking, saving through deals and offers, convenient package tracking, and redemption of shopping rewards. Our PayPal- and Venmo-branded debit and credit cards give consumers the ability to transact in-person through our platform and earn incentives, including cash-back rewards.\nWe also offer consumers person-to-person (\u201cP2P\u201d) payment solutions for domestic and international transfers through our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products and services. Our Venmo digital wallet in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers. Our Xoom international money transfer service enables our customers to send money to people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way. P2P is an important source of customer engagement and also serves as a customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential users to establish active accounts with PayPal or Venmo at the time they make or receive a P2P payment.\nWe offer credit products to eligible consumers in certain markets as a funding source at checkout. Our consumer credit offerings include our buy now, pay later products in the U.S., United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d), France, and Germany, among other markets, and in Japan through our Paidy brand. A key attribute of our buy now, pay later products is the absence of interest or consumer late fees for missed payments in most of the geographies where we offer them. Further, we offer interest-bearing installment products for consumers in the U.S. (issued by an independent chartered financial institution) and in Germany. In the U.S., consumers may apply for our PayPal- and Venmo-branded consumer credit cards and our PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product, which are offered through a partnership with an independent chartered financial institution. We offer a PayPal-issued PayPal Credit product in the U.K. We believe that our consumer credit products help us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided network.\nWe generate revenue from consumers from: foreign currency conversions, instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, and facilitating the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; interest, fees, or other revenue from our credit products; and other miscellaneous fees. We also earn revenue from interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\nMerchant value proposition\nMerchants use our solutions to increase conversion rates and grow and manage their business. We employ a technology and platform agnostic approach intended to enable merchants of all sizes to utilize our various products. Our diversified suite of products and services is tailored to meet the needs of merchants regardless of their size or business complexity. We offer a seamless omnichannel solution that helps merchants manage and grow their business.\nOur PayPal and Venmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. These seamless experiences reduce cart abandonment and drive higher conversion rates for merchants. Our buy now, pay later solutions are embedded into our branded checkout experiences, which can help increase consumer spend and enable merchants to grow sales.\nOur unbranded payments processing solutions, which includes Braintree and PayPal Complete Payments, allow merchants to quickly and easily provide digital checkout online with a variety of popular ways to pay, including debit and credit cards, digital wallets, PayPal Pay Later, and local payment methods.\nWe offer a suite of value added services, including payouts, payments orchestration, and fraud prevention and risk management solutions that help reduce merchant losses through proprietary protection programs. We also offer omnichannel solutions that allow merchants to make sales in person using our Zettle by PayPal app, card reader, or point of sale systems.\n6\nTable of Contents\nWe offer access to merchant financing products for eligible small and medium-sized businesses through the PPWC and PPBL products, which we collectively refer to as our merchant financing solutions. The PPWC product allows businesses to access a loan or cash advance for a fixed fee, based on their annual payment volume processed by PayPal. The PPBL product provides businesses with access to short-term financing for a fixed fee or interest based on an evaluation of the applying business as well as the business owner. In the U.S., these products are provided under a program agreement with an independent chartered financial institution. We believe that our merchant financing solutions enable us to deepen our engagement with our existing small and medium-sized merchants and expand services to new merchants by providing access to capital that may not be available from traditional banks or other lenders.\nWe generate revenues from merchants primarily by charging fees for completing their payment transactions and other payment-related services. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our merchant loans and advances and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\nPROTECTING CONSUMERS AND MERCHANTS\nProtecting consumers and merchants on our payments platform from financial and fraud loss is important to successfully compete and sustainably grow our business. Fraudulent activities, such as account takeover, identity theft (including stolen financial information), and malicious activities by counterparties, represent a significant risk to consumers and merchants, as well as their payment partners. In addition to the protections afforded by applicable law, we provide consumers and merchants with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform. Our protection programs help protect both consumers and merchants from financial loss resulting from, among other things, counterparty non-performance. These programs are designed to promote confidence on the part of both consumers, who will be reimbursed in certain circumstances, such as not receiving their purchased item in the condition significantly as described, as well as merchants, who will receive payment in certain circumstances, such as establishing proof of shipment or delivery of an item to the customer. We believe that these programs are generally consistent with or broader than protections provided by other participants in the payments industry.\nOur ability to help protect both consumers and merchants is based largely on our proprietary, end-to-end payments platform and our ability to utilize the data from both sides of transactions on our two-sided network, specifically from buyers and sellers and from senders and receivers of payments. Our ongoing investment in systems and processes is designed to enhance the safety and security of our products and reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized as one of the world\u2019s most trusted payments brands.\nCOMPETITION\nThe global payments industry is highly competitive, dynamic, and innovative, and subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies, shifting user preferences and needs, price sensitivity of consumers and merchants, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge, businesses combine or enter into new partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business.\nOur business faces competition from a wide range of businesses and from all forms of physical and electronic payments. We face competition from banks and financial institutions, which provide traditional payment methods (particularly credit cards and debit cards (collectively, \u201cpayment cards\u201d), electronic bank transfers, credit, and installment methods), payment networks that facilitate payments for payment cards or proprietary retail networks, payment card processors, and \u201ccard on file\u201d services. We also face competition from providers offering a variety of payment products and services ranging from broader platform solutions to point solutions focused on a specific functionality or feature, including tokenized and contactless payment cards, digital wallets and mobile payments solutions, credit, installment or other buy now, pay later methods, real-time payment systems, P2P payments and money remittance services, card readers and other devices or technologies for payment at point of sale (such as contactless cards, tokenized cards, Near Field Communication (NFC) based solutions, and Quick Response (QR) code based solutions), value added services related to payments (such as payouts, payment orchestration, foreign exchange and risk solutions), virtual currencies (such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins) and distributed ledger technologies, and tools that simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers and merchants. Our products and services also face competition from paper-based payments (primarily cash and checks).\n7\nTable of Contents\nWe differentiate ourselves to consumers through our broad acceptance and the ability to use our products and services across multiple commerce channels, including e-commerce, mobile, and offline payments, and without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying; our customer service, dispute resolution, and purchase protection programs; and our ability to simplify and personalize shopping experiences. In addition, we differentiate ourselves to merchants through our ability to innovate and develop products and services that offer new payment experiences or functionality for our merchants, demonstrate that they may achieve incremental sales by using and offering our services to consumers, and support transactions on our payments platform across varied technologies and payment methods; through the simplicity and transparency of our fee structure; and through our seller protection programs, analytics, and risk management, as well as other merchant services. We invest resources to improve our products and services and expand their acceptance, offer choice in payment options, provide excellent customer service, and build brands that both consumers and merchants trust.\nIn addition to the discussion in this section, see\u00a0\u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d under the caption \u201c\nWe face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry\u201d\nfor further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business.\nSTRATEGY\nOur ability to grow revenue is affected by, among other things, the macroeconomic environment and its impact on commerce and economic growth, consumer spending patterns, adoption of digital payment methods, the expansion of multiple commerce channels, the growth of mobile devices and commerce and payment applications on those devices, the growth of consumers and merchants globally with internet and mobile access, the pace of transition from cash and checks to digital forms of payment, our share of digital payments, and our ability to innovate and introduce new products, services, and features that consumers and merchants value.\u00a0Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:\n\u2022\nAccelerating growth in our branded checkout business\n:\nby improving our user experience, including by reducing friction and enhancing rewards, we will drive consumer selection and increase conversion rates for merchants. This strategy will increase our customers\u2019 engagement with our products and services. A critical element of our overall growth strategy involves driving an increase in monthly active accounts, which we expect will contribute to growth in payment transactions, TPV, and net revenues.\n\u2022\nExpanding our value proposition for consumers and merchants to drive daily use\n:\nby providing consumers with simple, secure, and flexible ways to manage and move money across different markets, merchants, and platforms, including offering purchase protection programs and simplifying their shopping experiences; by being technology and platform agnostic and by expanding and launching capabilities that allow us to process payments anywhere; by partnering with our merchants to grow and expand their business online and offline, including offering merchants risk management and seller protection programs; and by delivering payment-adjacent capabilities.\n\u2022\nUnlocking the power of data\n:\nby responsibly utilizing data in our two-sided platform to personalize consumer offerings, we will create more value for our customers, improve the interconnectedness of our platform, and tap into new sources of revenue and profitable growth.\n\u2022\nIncreasing offline engagement\n:\nthrough our PayPal-branded debit and credit cards, rewards programs, and seamless integration into other digital wallets that support in-store payments, we are giving consumers more reasons to use PayPal and Venmo for offline purchases. Providing consumers more opportunities to use PayPal for omnichannel purchases will help us to drive engagement.\n\u2022\nBuilding and expanding strategic partnerships\n:\nby building new strategic partnerships and deepening existing ones to provide better experiences for our customers, offer greater choice and flexibility, acquire new customers, and reinforce our role in the payments and commerce ecosystem.\n\u2022\nOne PayPal platform:\nby investing in state-of-the-art technology, architecture, and processes to deliver high-quality products and services to our customers more efficiently and effectively.\n\u2022\nSeeking new areas of growth\n:\ninnovate the future of commerce by focusing on creating new products in both the digital and physical worlds and finding opportunities to expand and improve upon our existing products and capabilities.\n8\nTable of Contents\nTECHNOLOGY\nOur payments platform utilizes a combination of proprietary and third-party technologies and services intended to facilitate transactions efficiently and securely between millions of consumers and merchants worldwide across different channels, markets, and networks. Our payments platform connects with financial services providers around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a wide range of payment methods, regardless of where a merchant is located. Consumers who use our payments platform can send payments in approximately 200 markets around the world and in approximately 140 currencies, withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 57 currencies, and hold balances in their eligible PayPal accounts in 24 currencies.\nWe have developed intuitive user interfaces, customer tools, transaction management databases, and payment network integrations on our platform designed to enable our customers to utilize our suite of products and services. Our payments platform, open application programming interfaces, and developer tools are designed to enable developers to innovate with ease and offer robust solutions to our global ecosystem of consumers and merchants, while at the same time helping to maintain the security of our customers\u2019 information.\nThe technology infrastructure supporting our payments platform is designed to simplify the storage and processing of large amounts of data and facilitate the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services in both our own data centers and when hosted by third-party cloud service providers. Our technology infrastructure is designed around industry best practices intended to reduce downtime and help ensure the resiliency of our payments platform in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. Our payments platform incorporates multiple layers of protection for business continuity and system redundancy purposes and to help mitigate cybersecurity risks. We have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect our technology infrastructure and payments platform against cybersecurity threats, which includes regularly testing our systems to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. We strive to continually improve our technology infrastructure and payments platform to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency, scalability, and security.\nFor additional information regarding risks relating to our technology infrastructure and cybersecurity, see the information in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d under the captions \u201c\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition\n\u201d and \u201c\nBusiness interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites, applications, products or services, or otherwise harm our business\n.\u201d\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nOur total research and development expense was $1.5 billion, $1.6\u00a0billion, and $1.7\u00a0billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nThe protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, patents, and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws, regulations, and administrative procedures in the U.S. and internationally. We have registered our core brands as domain names and as trademarks in the U.S. and many international jurisdictions. We also have an active program to secure and enforce trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest. We have filed and continue to file patent applications in the U.S. and in international jurisdictions covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology and new innovations. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services. We routinely enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control access to, and use and disclosure of, our proprietary information.\nFor additional information regarding risks relating to our intellectual property, see\u00a0the information in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d under the captions \u201c\nThird parties may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights\n\u201d and \u201c\nWe may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property\n.\u201d\n9\nTable of Contents\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including anti-money laundering, countering terrorist financing, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.\nGovernment regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in the markets we operate, which are subject to interpretation and change.\nPayments regulation.\nVarious laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. These licenses include not only our PayPal-branded products and services, but also our Venmo, Hyperwallet, Xoom, and Zettle products and services, to the extent offered in these locations. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to, among other requirements, restrictions on the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. In certain cases, these licenses also generally cover PayPal\u2019s service enabling customers to buy, hold, transfer, and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal or Venmo account. In the State of New York, PayPal holds a full Bitlicense issued by the New York Department of Financial Services to offer cryptocurrency services in the state.\nOutside the U.S., we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Among other regulatory authorities, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the \u201cCSSF\u201d), the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, and the Central Bank of Brazil have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions. This list is not exhaustive, and there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have asserted or may assert jurisdiction over our activities.\nIn addition, financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), have implemented payment authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, make it more difficult for new customers to open PayPal accounts, and reduce the ease of use of our products.\nFinancial Services supervision\n.\nWe serve our customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe) S.\u00e0.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. (\u201cPayPal (Europe)\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg by the CSSF.\nWe serve our customers in the U.K. through PayPal U.K. Limited (\u201cPayPal U.K.\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is subject to regulation as an electronic money institution in the U.K. by the FCA. Accordingly, we must comply with rules and regulations applicable to electronic money institutions in the U.K. and credit institutions in the E.U., including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate governance, anti-money laundering, consumer rights, disclosure, reporting, and inspection. We are, or may be, subject to financial services-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial services industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and examination by the regulators of these partner financial institutions.\nLending regulation\n.\nOur U.S. consumer short-term, interest-free, installment product is subject to federal and state laws governing consumer credit and debt collection, and PayPal holds multiple state licenses as the lender for this product. In Australia, PayPal Credit Pty Limited offers a consumer short-term, interest-free, installment product that is exempt from regulation by the primary consumer credit legislation, but is subject to other laws which cover the provision of financial services, credit reporting, debt collection, and privacy. PayPal\u2019s consumer short-term, interest-free, installment products in the U.K., France, Germany, Spain, and Italy are generally exempt from primary consumer credit legislation; however, certain consumer lending laws, consumer protection, and banking transparency regulations apply to this activity. Paidy, Inc. holds multiple licenses for the issuance of its consumer installment products in Japan and is registered with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry as a Comprehensive Credit Purchase Intermediary.\n10\nTable of Contents\nOur U.S. consumer interest-bearing installment product is subject to federal and state laws and is offered by an independent chartered financial institution. PayPal\u2019s interest-bearing installment product for consumers in Germany is subject to applicable local laws such as consumer (lending) laws, consumer protection, or banking transparency regulations. These loans are originated by PayPal (Europe).\nPayPal and Venmo co-branded consumer credit cards and the PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product are issued by an independent chartered financial institution in the U.S., and are subject to laws and regulations governing these programs. PayPal Credit in the U.K. is a regulated, revolving consumer credit product subject to applicable local laws and regulations.\nOur U.S. merchant lending products are subject to federal and state regulations and are offered by an independent chartered financial institution. Our merchant lending products offered in Germany, France, and the Netherlands are subject to the laws of Luxembourg and certain local laws, and our merchant lending product offered in the U.K. is subject to U.K. regulation. The loans offered to European and U.K. merchants are originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., respectively. Our merchant lending product in Australia is subject to the laws of Australia and is originated by PayPal Credit Pty Limited.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d).\nThe CFPB has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the U.S., including consumer credit, deposits, payments, and similar products. As a large market participant of remittance transfers, we are subject to the direct supervisory authority of the CFPB. The CFPB and similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may materially impact our business.\nAnti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and sanctions.\nPayPal is subject to anti-money laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. Our AML program is designed to prevent our payments platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs, overseen by our AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer, are composed of policies, procedures, and internal controls, and are designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\nInterchange fees.\nInterchange fees (the transaction fees for processing credit and debit card transactions) are subject to regulation in certain jurisdictions. For example, in the EU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee Regulation caps interchange fees and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with payment card transactions. Interchange fees are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge.\nData protection and privacy.\nWe are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations (\u201cprivacy and data protection laws\u201d) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer (collectively, \u201cprocessing\u201d) of personally identifiable information about our customers, our merchants\u2019 customers, and employees (\u201cpersonal data\u201d) in the countries where we operate. Our business relies on the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial information associated with individuals, is subject to one or more privacy and data protection laws in one or more jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.\nRegulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world. Regulatory authorities are continuously considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals and interpretive guidelines that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted, or are in the process of adopting or amending data protection and privacy legislation or regulation aimed at creating and enhancing individual privacy rights and data protection obligations. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are subject to change and may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs.\nAnti-corruption.\nPayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.\n11\nTable of Contents\nAdditional regulatory developments.\nVarious regulatory agencies continue to examine and implement laws governing a wide variety of issues, including virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, competition, and marketing, which may impact PayPal\u2019s business. Certain governments around the world are adopting laws and regulations pertaining to environmental, social, and governance matters, and corporate sustainability performance, transparency, and reporting (e.g., the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), as well as topical reporting and risk management disclosure requirements, such as obligations related to disclosure of the management of climate-related risks.\nFor an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\u201d\nand \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d included in this Form 10-K.\nCORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY & IMPACT MANAGEMENT\nPayPal is committed to creating a more inclusive digital economy for the customers and communities we serve across the world. Our management of priority Corporate Sustainability & Impact (\u201cCS&I\u201d) risks and opportunities in respect of our business is organized across employees and culture, social impact, responsible business practices, and environmental sustainability. We believe this integrated, enterprise-wide approach to managing our global business helps enable us to create value for our stakeholders, including our stockholders, employees, partners, and communities. We continue to prioritize efforts to manage key non-financial factors impacting our long-term business, including fostering an inclusive culture across the employee experience, utilizing PayPal\u2019s unique capabilities and resources to support inclusive entrepreneurship and small business success, further enhancements to support the safety and security of our products and platform, and progress on reducing our environmental impacts. We endeavor to provide transparent disclosures with respect to our CS&I risks and opportunities through our annual Global Impact Report and other communications.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nAt PayPal, we consider the management of our global talent (human capital) to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. As of December\u00a031, 2024, we employed approximately 24,400 people globally, with 44% in the Americas, 44% in Asia-Pacific, and 12% in Europe and the Middle East. Our global employees work predominantly full-time and represent at least 140 nationalities, across 28 countries, including approximately 8,900 located in the U.S. Across our workforce, we reached approximately 43% global gender diversity and 55% U.S. ethnic diversity, as of December\u00a031, 2024.\nAs a leading technology platform, we compete for top talent from around the world. We believe that a strong culture focused on employee experiences that enable advancement, learning, and individual career insights is essential to the successful acquisition, development, and retention of global talent. In 2024, we continued to build employee awareness and engagement in our leadership principles to establish a common set of expectations for all employees. We also continued to integrate these principles across our global talent strategy to help shape our programs throughout the employee lifecycle and achieve key business priorities. We use employee feedback to directly inform the ongoing development of our employee programs. In addition to administering an annual survey to gather input from our global workforce, we also conducted specific surveys to gather direct employee feedback on specific topics.\nWe remain focused on promoting the holistic well-being of our employees, including providing resources, programs, and services to support our employees\u2019 physical, mental, and financial wellness. PayPal offers a comprehensive benefits package designed to support employees at every stage of life while helping our employees to prepare for the future.\nWe are committed to equal pay for equal work and promoting enterprise-wide inclusive learning opportunities.\nIn October 2024, we moved to hybrid as our primary way of working at PayPal. As of December 31, 2024, approximately half of our employees worked a hybrid schedule while the remaining were fully virtual. Across PayPal, we are focused on providing tools and resources to support our distributed teams.\n12\nTable of Contents\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nThe address of our principal executive offices is PayPal Holdings, Inc., 2211 North First Street, San Jose, California 95131.

RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information appearing in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that could affect us. These risk factors do not identify all risks we face, and additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, future prospects, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.\nCYBERSECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY RISKS\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition.\nThe techniques used to attempt to obtain unauthorized or illegal access to systems and information (including customers\u2019 personal data), disable or degrade service, exploit vulnerabilities, or sabotage systems are continuously evolving. In some circumstances, these attempts may not be recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. Unauthorized parties continuously attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including through hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners, or vendors, and attempting to fraudulently induce users of our systems (including employees, vendor and partner personnel and customers) into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, multi-factor authentication application access or other sensitive information used to gain access to such systems or facilities. This information may, in turn, be used to access our customers\u2019 confidential personal or proprietary information and financial instrument data that are stored on or accessible through our information technology systems and those of third parties with whom we partner. This information may also be used to execute fraudulent transactions or otherwise engage in fraudulent actions. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity and related threats, including advanced and persisting cyberattacks, cyberextortion, distributed denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, spear phishing and social engineering schemes, the introduction of computer viruses or other malware, and the physical destruction of all or portions of our information technology and infrastructure and those of third parties with whom we partner or that are part of our information technology supply chain, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, may be difficult to detect, and could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data in our systems, as well as the systems themselves.\nWe believe that hostile actors, who may comprise individuals, coordinated groups, sophisticated organizations, or nation state supported entities, may target PayPal due to our name, brand recognition, types of data (including sensitive payments- and identity-related data) that customers provide to us, and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of our security measures, network breaches, and compromise of personally identifiable customer information due to human error, deception, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors, defects, vulnerabilities, or other issues. Any of the foregoing events may subject us to fines, penalties, regulatory or other enforcement actions, and our business, reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected.\nAny cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting the information technology or infrastructure of our customers, partners, or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) or of companies we acquire, could have similar negative effects.\nUnder payment card network rules and our contracts with our payment processors, if there is a breach of payment card information stored by us or our direct payment card processing vendors, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks, including for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We have experienced, and may experience in the future, breaches involving customer information for which we have notified, and may notify, regulators, customers and other third parties. These or other cybersecurity breaches and other exploited security vulnerabilities have subjected us and could further subject us to significant costs and third-party liabilities, result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws, require us to change our business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, damage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to or claims by them, or expose us to litigation, regulatory investigations, and significant fines and penalties. Moreover, under payment card network rules and our contracts with our payment processors, if there is a breach of payment card information stored by us or our direct payment card processing vendors, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks, including for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. While we maintain insurance policies intended to help offset the financial impact we may experience from these risks, our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by security breaches and other damage to or\n14\nTable of Contents\nunavailability of our systems.\nBusiness interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites, applications, products or services, or otherwise harm our business.\nOur systems and operations and those of our service providers and partners have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, business interruptions or degradation of service because of distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, insider threats, hardware and software defects or malfunctions, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, and other natural disasters, public health crises (including pandemics), power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. The frequency and intensity of weather events related to climate change are increasing, which could increase the likelihood and severity of such disasters as well as related damage and business interruption. Our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a seismically active region in California. A catastrophic event that could lead to a disruption or failure of our systems or operations could result in significant losses and require substantial recovery time and significant expenditures to resume or maintain operations. Further, some of our systems, including those of companies that we have acquired, are not fully redundant and any failure of these acquired systems, including due to a catastrophic event, may lead to operational outages or delays. While we engage in disaster recovery planning and testing intended to mitigate risks from outages or delays, our planning and testing may not be effective or sufficient for all possible outcomes or events. As a provider of payments solutions, we are also subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans, and rigorous testing of such plans, which may be costly and time-consuming to implement, and may divert our resources from other business priorities. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, system failures, cyberattacks, unplanned outages, and other events or conditions from time to time that have and may interrupt the availability, or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality, of our products and services. While we continue to undertake system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve the availability, reliability, resiliency, and speed of our payments platform, these efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical complexity and risk, may divert our resources from new features and products, and may ultimately not be effective. A prolonged interruption of, or reduction in, the availability, speed, or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business and financial condition. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could permanently harm our relationship with our customers and partners and our reputation. If any system failure or similar event results in damage to our customers or their business partners, they could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses. These claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.\nWe also rely on facilities, components, applications, software, and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud data storage and processing services. From time to time, we have experienced interruptions in the provision of such facilities and services provided by these third parties. If these third parties experience operational interference or disruptions (including a cybersecurity incident), fail to perform their obligations, or breach their agreements with us, our operations could be disrupted or negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, regulatory scrutiny, and damage to our reputation and brands, and materially and adversely affect our business. While we maintain insurance policies intended to help offset the financial impact we may experience from these risks, our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by interruptions in our service due to systems failures and similar events.\nIn addition, any failure to successfully implement new information systems and technologies or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies in a timely manner could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business, adversely impact our business, internal controls, results of operations, and financial condition, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business.\nIf we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues, could decline.\nRapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, including payment technologies (including real-time payments, payment card tokenization, virtual currencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and proximity payment technology such as Near Field Communication and other contactless payments); internet browser technologies that enable users to easily store their payment card information for use on any retail or e-commerce website; artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) and machine learning; developments in technologies supporting our regulatory and\n15\nTable of Contents\ncompliance obligations; and in-store, digital, and social commerce.\nWe expect that new technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate, including the development, adoption, and use of generative AI technologies, will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. We cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business, which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted, and how those technologies may be regulated. Developing and incorporating new technologies into new and existing products and services may require significant investment, take considerable time, and may not ultimately be successful. For example, AI algorithms that we use may be flawed or may be based on datasets that are biased or insufficient. In addition, any latency, disruption, or failure in our AI systems or infrastructure could result in delays or errors in our offerings. There also may be real or perceived social harm, unfairness, or other outcomes that undermine public confidence in the use of our products or of AI. In addition, third parties may deploy AI technologies in a manner that reduces customer demand for our products and services.\nWe rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new or evolving technologies. These third parties may restrict or prevent our access to, or utilization of, those technologies, as well as their platforms or products. Our ability to develop, provide or incorporate new technologies and adapt our existing products and services or develop future and new products and services using new technologies may be limited or restricted by industry-wide standards, platform providers, payments networks, changes to laws and regulations, changing customer expectations, third-party intellectual property rights, and other factors. If we are unable to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business, results of operations, or reputation could be harmed.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business.\nOur business is subject to complex and changing laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations in the markets in which we offer services directly or through partners, including, but not limited to, those governing: banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, prepaid access, foreign currency exchange, privacy, data protection, data governance, cybersecurity, banking secrecy, digital payments, cryptocurrency, payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), lending, fraud detection, consumer protection, antitrust and competition, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing.\nRegulators and legislators globally have been establishing, evolving, and increasing their regulatory authority, oversight, and enforcement in a manner that impacts our business. As we introduce new products and services and expand into new markets, including through acquisitions, we expect to become subject to additional regulations, restrictions, and licensing requirements. As we expand and localize our international activities, we expect that our obligations in the markets in which we operate will continue to increase. In addition, because we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws, which may impose different, more specific, or conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability.\nAny failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations, or orders of any government authority (including changes to or expansion of their interpretation) may subject us to significant fines, penalties, monetary damages, injunctive relief, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; cause us to lose existing licenses or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business; restrict our operations; lead to increased friction for customers; force us to make changes to our business practices, products, or operations; require us to engage in remediation activities; or delay planned transactions, product launches, or improvements. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The complexity of U.S. federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. While we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, and agents will not violate such laws and regulations.\nPayments Regulation\n16\nTable of Contents\nIn the U.S., PayPal, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations required to maintain our licenses, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states or territories, forced to change our business practices, or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose substantial costs and harm our business.\nWhile we currently allow our customers to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can hold balances or withdraw funds. These restrictions may limit our ability to grow our business.\nWe principally provide our services to customers in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) through PayPal (Europe) S.\u00e0.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. (\u201cPayPal (Europe)\u201d), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg and PayPal U.K. Limited (\u201cPayPal U.K.\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is subject to regulation as an electronic money institution and a consumer credit firm (and registration as a crypto asset business) in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) by the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d). PayPal (Europe) or PayPal U.K. may be subject to enforcement actions and significant fines and penalties if either violates applicable requirements. If the business activities of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (\u201cECB\u201d) so determines, PayPal (Europe) may be deemed a significant supervised entity and certain activities of PayPal (Europe) would become directly supervised by the ECB, rather than by the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier. PayPal (Europe) is also subject to regulation by the ECB under the oversight framework for electronic payment instruments, schemes and arrangements (\u201cPISA\u201d). Compliance with applicable laws and regulations could become more costly and operationally difficult to manage due to additional supervision, potentially inconsistent interpretations, and domestic regulations by various countries in the region. Applicable regulation relating to payments, anti-money laundering, and digital services, which are key focus areas of regulators and subject to extensive new regulation, could subject us to additional and complex obligations, risks, and associated costs, and impact our ability to expand our business in Europe.\nFor many of the other markets outside the U.S., we provide services on a cross-border basis through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (\u201cMAS\u201d). As of July 1, 2023, PayPal Pte. Ltd. has been issued a Major Payment Institution license by the MAS under the Payment Services Act 2019. In order to maintain this license and certain other licenses or registrations we hold in certain markets, we are required to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, which have imposed and will continue to impose increasing operational complexity and costs for our Singapore and international operations. Moreover, in many non-U.S. markets (other than Singapore) where customers of PayPal Pte. Ltd. or local branches or subsidiaries subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight, as the case may be, are located, there may be uncertainty whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or also to other local laws, and whether such local laws might require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution, or otherwise.\nThere are substantial costs and potential product and operational changes involved in maintaining and renewing licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, penalties, and litigation if we are found to violate any of these requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) continue to apply for or obtain any licenses, renewals, certifications, and approvals in any jurisdiction. In certain markets, we may need to rely on local banks or other partners to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local currency, and local regulators may use their authority over such local partners to prohibit, restrict, or limit us from doing business. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, result in substantial additional costs, delay or preclude planned transactions, geographical expansions, or product launches or improvements, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, products and services, or prevent or limit us from providing our products or services in a given market.\nCryptocurrency Regulation and Related Risks\nOur customer cryptocurrency offerings could subject us to additional regulations, licensing requirements, or other obligations or liabilities. Within the U.S., we are regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services as a virtual currency business, which does not qualify us to engage in securities brokerage or dealing activities. The regulatory status of particular cryptocurrencies is unclear under existing law. For example, if the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) were to assert that any of the cryptocurrencies we support are securities, the SEC could assert that our activities involving that cryptocurrency require securities broker-dealer registration or other obligations under the federal securities laws. The rapidly evolving\n17\nTable of Contents\nlegislative and regulatory landscapes with respect to cryptocurrency may subject us to additional licensing and regulatory obligations or to additional inquiries or investigations from the SEC or other regulators and governmental authorities, and require us to make product changes, restrict or discontinue product offerings in certain markets, implement additional and potentially costly controls, or take other actions.\nIn August 2023, a third-party issuer with which we have partnered commercially (the \u201cPYUSD Issuer\u201d) launched a U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin named PayPal USD (\u201cPYUSD\u201d), which is available to PayPal U.S. customers and Venmo customers. These PayPal and Venmo customers may, if provisioned for external transfers and subject to our sanctions and anti-money laundering controls, send PYUSD to external wallets not controlled by PayPal. The PYUSD Issuer may also allow institutional users to directly purchase PYUSD from the PYUSD Issuer (as per the PYUSD Issuer\u2019s stablecoin terms and conditions). The regulatory treatment of stablecoins is evolving and has drawn significant attention from legislative and regulatory bodies around the world, including the SEC. There are uncertainties on how ongoing changes to federal, state, and international laws and regulations would apply to stablecoins in practice, and we and the PYUSD Issuer may face substantial costs to operationalize and comply with any additional or changed requirement. If we or the PYUSD Issuer fail to comply with regulations, requirements, prohibitions or other obligations applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions, potential fines, penalties, and other consequences. In addition, we could face reputational harm through our relationship with the PYUSD Issuer if the PYUSD Issuer were to face regulatory scrutiny, PYUSD is deemed to be a security, or PYUSD is alleged to be used for transactions in connection with illicit or illegal activities.\nWe hold our customers\u2019 cryptocurrency assets through one or more third-party custodians. Financial and third-party risks related to our customer cryptocurrency offerings, such as inappropriate access to, theft, or destruction of cryptocurrency assets held by our custodians, insufficient insurance coverage by a custodian to reimburse us for all such losses, a custodian\u2019s failure to maintain effective controls over the custody and settlement services provided to us, a custodian\u2019s inability to purchase or liquidate cryptocurrency holdings, the failure of the PYUSD Issuer to maintain sufficient reserve assets backing PYUSD and defaults on financial or performance obligations by a custodian, banks with which the PYUSD Issuer maintains reserve assets or counterparty financial institutions, could expose our customers and us to loss, and significantly harm our business, financial condition, and reputation.\nWe have selected custodian partners and the PYUSD Issuer, and may in the future select additional custodian partners and stablecoin issuing entities, that are subject to regulatory oversight, capital requirements, maintenance of audit and compliance industry certifications, and cybersecurity procedures and policies. Nevertheless, any operational disruptions at any such custodian or issuer, or such custodians\u2019 or issuer\u2019s failure to safeguard cryptocurrency holdings (or reserve assets), could result in losses of customer assets, expose us to customer claims, reduce consumer confidence and materially impact our cryptocurrency product offerings and our operating results.\nCustodial arrangements to safeguard cryptocurrency assets involve unique risks and uncertainties in the event of a custodian\u2019s bankruptcy. While other types of assets and some custodied cryptocurrencies have been deemed not to be part of the custodian\u2019s bankruptcy estate under various regulatory regimes, bankruptcy courts have not yet definitively determined the appropriate treatment of custodial holdings of digital assets in a bankruptcy proceeding. In the event of a custodian\u2019s bankruptcy, the lack of precedent and the highly fact-dependent nature of the determination could delay or preclude the return of custodied cryptocurrency assets to us or to our customers. Although we contractually require our custodians to segregate our customer assets and not commingle them with proprietary or other assets, we cannot be certain that these contractual obligations, even if duly observed by a custodian, will be effective in preventing such assets from being treated as part of the custodian\u2019s estate under bankruptcy or other insolvency law. In that event, our claim on behalf of such customers against a custodian\u2019s estate for our customers\u2019 cryptocurrency assets could be treated as a general unsecured claim against the custodian, in which case our customers could seek to hold us liable for any resulting losses.\nLending Regulation\nWe hold a number of U.S. state lending licenses for our U.S. consumer short-term installment loan product, which is subject to federal and state laws governing consumer credit and debt collection. Similarly, the consumer short-term installment loan products that we offer outside the U.S. may be subject to consumer credit legislation, licensing requirements, consumer lending laws, consumer protection or banking transparency regulations. Increased global regulatory focus on short-term installment products and consumer credit more broadly could result in laws or regulations requiring changes to our policies, procedures, operations, and product offerings, and restrict or limit our ability to offer credit products.\nConsumer Protection\n18\nTable of Contents\nViolations of consumer protection law in applicable jurisdictions, including both federal and state laws and regulations in the U.S., such as the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (\u201cEFTA\u201d) and Regulation E as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), could result in the assessment of significant actual damages or statutory damages or penalties (including treble damages in some instances) and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).\nIn addition, the CFPB, pursuant to its market-monitoring authority, may require us to provide extensive information on our products and offerings. From time to time, we have received orders from the CFPB pursuant to such market-monitoring authority requiring us to provide, among other items, extensive information on our payment products, including with respect to the collection, use of, and access to data and consumer protections, as well as our Buy Now, Pay Later offerings.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing; Economic and Trade Sanctions\nRegulators globally continue to increase standards and expectations regarding anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, and to expand the scope of existing laws and regulations to emerging products and markets, which may require us to revise or expand our compliance program globally and/or in specific jurisdictions, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Such changes could have the effect of making compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or the circumstances in which we must verify identities of customers, and any change to such obligations could result in greater compliance costs and impact our business. We are also required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S., the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and its member states, the U.K., and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations or economic and trade sanctions may subject us to significant fines, penalties, lawsuits, and enforcement actions, result in regulatory sanctions and additional compliance requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations, and damage our reputation and brands. In the ordinary course of business we may identify and voluntarily report, and have reported, potential compliance issues to regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), and our compliance history may be considered by OFAC and other regulators as part of any potential future investigation of our sanctions regulation.\nPrivacy and Protection of Customer Data\nThe legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws continues to develop and evolve in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to technologies such as cloud computing, (generative) AI, machine learning, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. Any failure or alleged failure by us to comply with our privacy policies as communicated to customers or with privacy and data protection laws relating to our collection, use, storage, transfer, or sharing of customer data with third parties\ncould result in proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities, other government agencies, our customers or others, which could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, result in reputational harm, and materially harm our business. Compliance with inconsistent privacy and data protection laws may also restrict or limit our ability to provide products and services to our customers.\nMany jurisdictions in which we operate globally have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, data privacy legislation or regulations aimed at creating and enhancing individual privacy rights, including with respect to the use of personal data for personalization and cross-contextual advertising. For example, numerous U.S. states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and retention of their residents\u2019 personal information as well as specific privacy obligations around youth. The continued proliferation of privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate is likely to result in a disparate array of privacy rules with unaligned or conflicting provisions, accountability requirements, individual rights, and national or local enforcement powers, which may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs and could lead to unintended consumer confusion.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nThe legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI technologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain, including in the areas of consumer protection, intellectual property, cybersecurity, and privacy and data protection. In addition, there is uncertainty around the validity and enforceability of intellectual property rights related to the use, development, and deployment of AI-\n19\nTable of Contents\ngenerated outputs. Compliance with new and emerging laws, regulations or industry standards relating to AI in the U.S. and internationally, such as U.S. state regulations and the Artificial Intelligence Act in the EU, may impose significant operational costs and may limit our ability to develop, deploy or use existing or future AI technologies. As a result, our ability to adapt our existing products and services or develop future and new products and services using AI may be limited or restricted, which could adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to legal proceedings under antitrust and competition laws.\nWe are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies regarding antitrust and competition laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including in connection with proposed or implemented business combinations, acquisitions, investments, partnerships, commercial agreements and business practices. Some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct. Companies and government agencies have in the past alleged, and may in the future allege, that our actions (or actions of companies with which we have commercial agreements) violate the antitrust or competition laws in the U.S. or other jurisdictions in which we operate or otherwise constitute unfair competition, or that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without merit, may be costly to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity, cause substantial diversion of management\u2019s time and effort, and could result in reputational harm, significant judgments, fines and other remedial actions against us, require us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes, or delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements.\nWe are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory scrutiny, and government inquiries.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, actions or requests, and other proceedings alleging violations of laws, rules, and regulations with respect to competition, antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, consumer protection (including unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices), the terms of our customer agreements, fraud, accessibility, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services, charitable fundraising, contract disputes, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, product liability, use of our services for illegal purposes, the matters described in \u201cNote 13\u2014Commitments and Contingencies\u2014\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters\u2014General Matters\n\u201d to our consolidated financial statements, and other matters. We expect that the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries will continue to increase as our products, services, and business expand in complexity, scale, scope, and geographic reach, including through acquisitions of businesses and technology. Investigations and legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and could result in substantial judgments, fines, penalties or settlements, substantial diversion of management\u2019s time and effort, negative publicity, reputational harm, criminal sanctions, or orders that prevent or limit us from offering certain products or services; require us to change our business practices or customer agreement terms in ways that may increase costs or reduce revenues, develop non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, or pay substantial royalty or licensing fees; or delay or preclude planned transactions or product launches or improvements. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves significant estimates and judgments and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. We may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. If our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThird parties may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights.\nWe are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Intellectual property infringement claims against us may result from, among other things, our expansion into new business areas, including through acquisitions of businesses and technology, or new or expanded products and services and their convergence with technologies not previously associated with areas related to our business, products and services. The ultimate outcome of any allegation or claim is often uncertain and any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business, result in reputational harm, and require us to, among other things, redesign or stop providing our products or services, pay substantial amounts to settle claims or lawsuits, satisfy judgments, or pay substantial royalty or licensing fees.\nWe may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property.\nThe protection of our proprietary rights, including our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, patents and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. Effective protection of our proprietary rights may not be available in every jurisdiction in which we offer our products and services. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual\n20\nTable of Contents\nproperty, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, that our contractual arrangements will prevent or deter third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property, or that third parties will not independently develop equivalent or superior intellectual property rights. We may be required to expend significant time and resources to prevent infringement and enforce our rights, and we may be unable to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or otherwise violating our proprietary rights, the uniqueness and value of our products and services could be adversely affected, the value of our brands could be diminished, and our business could be adversely affected. We expect to continue to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business.\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONS RISKS\nWe face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry.\nThe global payments industry is highly competitive, dynamic, and innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies, shifting user preferences and needs, price sensitivity of consumers and merchants, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge, businesses combine or enter into new partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business.\nWe compete with a wide range of businesses in every aspect of our business. Some of our current and potential competitors are or may be larger than we are, have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, a dominant or more secure position, broader geographic scope, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, or offer products and services that we do not offer. Other competitors are or may be smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding to regulatory and technological changes and customer preferences. Our competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and/or offer lower prices or more effectively offer their own innovative programs, products, and services. We often partner with other businesses, and the ability to continue developing these partnerships is important to our business. Competition for relationships with these partners is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish, grow, or maintain these partner relationships. If we are unable to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers and adoption of our products and services, or effectively and efficiently align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business.\nTo process certain transactions, we must comply with applicable payment card, bank or other network (collectively, \u201cnetwork\u201d) rules. The rules govern all aspects of a transaction on the networks, including fees and other practices. From time to time, the networks have increased the fees and assessments that they charge for transactions that access their networks. Certain networks have also imposed special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a digital wallet such as the one that PayPal offers. Our payment processors may have the right to pass any increases in fees and assessments on to us and to increase their own fees for processing. Any increase in interchange fees, special fees, or assessments for transactions that we pay to the networks or our payment processors could make our pricing less competitive, increase our operating costs, and reduce our operating income, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn some jurisdictions, government regulations have required payment card networks to reduce or cap interchange fees. Any changes in interchange fee rates or limitations, or their applicability to PayPal\u2019s products and services, could adversely affect our competitive position against payment card service providers and the revenue we earn from our branded card programs, require us to change our business practices, and harm our business.\nWe may also be subject to fines and other penalties assessed by networks resulting from any rule violations by us or our merchants. The networks set and interpret their rules, and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these rules, or our agreements with the networks. Such allegations may result in significant fines, penalties, damages, or other liabilities, adversely impact benefits to us under the agreements, or require changes in our business practices that may be costly and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise impact the development of, our products which may negatively affect product deployment and adoption. The networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that\n21\nTable of Contents\nwe or our payment processors might find difficult or impractical to follow, or costly to implement, which could require us to make significant changes to our products, increase our operational costs, and negatively impact our business. If we become unable or limited in our ability to accept certain payment types such as debit or credit cards, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business.\nWe pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, from an existing PayPal account balance or Venmo account balance, or through our PayPal branded consumer credit products. Our financial performance is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using payment cards, which can significantly increase our costs. Although we provide consumers in certain markets with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal account balance or Venmo account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, which may offer features and benefits not provided as part of their PayPal accounts. Any increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lower-cost funding options, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business.\nOur credit products expose us to additional risks.\nWe offer credit products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in the U.S. and various international markets. The financial success of these products depends largely on the effective management of related risk. The credit decision-making process for our consumer credit products uses proprietary methodologies and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on, among other factors, their past purchase and transaction history with PayPal or Venmo and their credit scores. Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who desire to use our merchant financing offerings to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions, including those related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions, economic environment, or limited transaction history or other data. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, issuing bank policies, and other factors.\nWe are subject to the risk that account holders who use our credit products will default on their payment obligations. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other factors, changes to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans. Further, laws or regulations may limit the assessment of late fees or penalties on certain credit products, which could negatively impact our revenue share arrangement with an independent chartered financial institution with respect to our U.S. consumer credit products. Any deterioration in the performance of loans facilitated through our platform or unexpected losses on such loans may increase the risk of potential charge-offs, increase our allowance for loans and interest receivable, negatively impact our revenue share arrangement (as discussed in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014\nKey Metrics and Financial Results\n\u201d), and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations\n.\nWe generally rely on the activities and charters of unaffiliated financial institutions to provide PayPal and Venmo branded consumer credit and merchant financing offerings to our U.S. customers. As a service provider to these unaffiliated financial institutions, which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions, we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators. In the event of any termination or interruption in a partner bank\u2019s ability or willingness to lend, our ability to offer consumer credit and merchant financing products could be interrupted or limited, which could materially and adversely affect our business. We may be unable to reach a similar arrangement with another unaffiliated financial institution on favorable terms or at all. Obtaining and maintaining the lending licenses required for us to originate such loans ourselves would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain process, and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could significantly increase our costs and compliance obligations and require us to change our business practices.\nMerchant loans under our U.S. PayPal Working Capital (\u201cPPWC\u201d) and PayPal Business Loan (\u201cPPBL\u201d) products and certain U.S. installment loan products are provided by a state-chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us, and we acquire the receivables generated by those loans from the state-chartered bank after origination. In June 2020, the Federal\n22\nTable of Contents\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) approved a final rule clarifying that loans validly originated by state-chartered banks or insured branches of foreign banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) in May 2020 for nationally chartered banks. The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called \u201cvalid-when-made doctrine,\u201d which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products, certain installment products, and our business.\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell U.K. and European buy now, pay later (\u201cBNPL\u201d) loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., consisting of the sale of a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe)\u2019s balance sheet at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans. The sale of future eligible receivables is subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under these arrangements, the sale of these receivables could be delayed and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement.\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our U.S. credit products to consumers, U.S. merchant financing, and branded credit card products; branded debit card and savings products issued by unaffiliated banks; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (including, but not limited to, data center facilities and cloud computing, information technology, and outsourced customer support and product development functions). We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party providers, including operational, legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, commercial, and resiliency risks. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, we are overly reliant on certain relationships, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships (including interruptions to the availability of our products and services), our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our relationships with third parties inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and compliance, which potentially increases our financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk.\nAny factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. In certain markets, cross-border trade represents our primary (and in some instances our only) offerings. Cross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including foreign exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers or restrictions, sanctions, import or export controls, and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences may increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\nWe expect that third parties will continue to attempt to abuse access to and misuse our payments services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information, taking over customer accounts or creating fraudulent accounts, making transactions with stolen financial instruments, abusing or misusing our services for financial gain, or fraudulently inducing users of our products and services into engaging in fraudulent transactions. Due to the nature of PayPal\u2019s digital payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical\n23\nTable of Contents\ntransactions. Measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud and abusive behavior are complex, require continuous improvement, and may not be effective in detecting and preventing fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new or expanded product offerings. If these measures are not effective, our business could be negatively impacted. We also incur substantial losses from erroneous transactions and situations where linked accounts designated by customers to fund PayPal transactions have insufficient funds or are otherwise unavailable to fund the payments, or the payment is initiated to an unintended recipient in error. Numerous and evolving fraud schemes and misuse of our payments services could subject us to significant costs and liabilities, require us to change our business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, damage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, and result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses or claims. While we actively seek to recover transaction losses where possible, such recoveries may be insufficient to compensate us for such losses.\nOur purchase and seller protection programs (\u201cprotection programs\u201d) are intended to reduce the likelihood of losses for consumers and merchants from unauthorized and fraudulent transactions. Our purchase protection program also protects consumers who do not receive the item ordered or who receive an item that is significantly different from its description. We incur substantial losses from our protection programs as a result of disputes filed by our customers. While we may seek to recover losses from our protection programs from the merchant, we ultimately may not be able to fully recover such losses (for example, if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay, the transaction involves a fraudulent merchant, or the merchant provides sufficient evidence that the item was delivered).\nIn addition, consumers who pay through PayPal or Venmo may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer, which in turn will seek recovery from us. If losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, we could lose the ability to accept payment cards for payment, which would negatively impact our business. Regulators and card networks may also adapt error resolution and chargeback requirements to account for evolving forms of fraud, which could increase PayPal\u2019s exposure to fraud losses and impact the scope of coverage of our protection programs. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changes to the scope of transactions covered by our protection programs, could negatively impact our business and results of operations. See \u201cNote 13\u2014Commitments and Contingencies\u2014\nProtection Programs\n\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nFailure to effectively monitor and evaluate the financial condition of our merchants may expose PayPal to losses. In the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, business failure, or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise, or concert tickets, custom-made goods, and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, including through our purchase protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their purchase. Allowances for transaction losses that we have established may be insufficient to cover incurred losses.\nUse of our payments services for illegal activities or improper purposes could harm our business.\nWe expect that users will continue to attempt to use our payments platform for illegal activities or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions evasion, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal telemarketing activities, illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted, trademarked or digital goods, bank fraud, child pornography, human trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, securities fraud, pyramid or Ponzi schemes, or the facilitation of other illegal or improper activity. Moreover, certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction, and a merchant may be found responsible for intentionally or inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items by a user. While we invest in measures intended to prevent and detect illegal activities that may occur on our payments platform, these measures may not be effective in detecting and preventing illegal activity or improper uses, and we may be subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory requests, inquiries, or investigations that could result in liability, restrict our operations, impose additional restrictions or limitations on our business or require us to change our business practices, harm our reputation, increase our costs, and negatively impact our business.\nAcquisitions, dispositions, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business.\nWe expect to continue to consider and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business\n24\nTable of Contents\nstrategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets; strategic investments; and commercial and strategic partnerships (collectively, \u201cstrategic transactions\u201d). At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more strategic transactions, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, consummating and integrating transaction opportunities. Strategic transactions may involve additional significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including challenges of obtaining regulatory or other approvals, integrating new employees, products, systems, technologies, operations, and business cultures; challenges associated with operating acquired businesses in markets or business areas in which we may have limited or no experience; disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management\u2019s attention; inadequate data security, cybersecurity, or operational and information technology resilience; failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, deficiencies and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets; potential exposure to new or incremental risks associated with acquired businesses and entities, strategic investments or other strategic transactions, including potential new or increased regulatory oversight and uncertain or evolving legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements, particularly with respect to companies in new or developing businesses or industries; challenges associated with dispositions of business or operations, including disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers, the transfer of technology and/or certain intellectual property rights to third-party purchasers, or exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to us following any such dispositions; failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy or for its anticipated benefits to materialize; potential impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets; and the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of significant additional debt. Strategic transactions are inherently risky, may not be successful, and may harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nStrategic investments in which we have a minority ownership stake inherently involve a lesser degree of influence over business operations. The success of our strategic investments may be dependent on controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities that may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and damage our reputation.\nOur international operations subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business.\nOur international operations generate a significant portion of our net revenues. Our international operations subject us to significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including, but not limited to, local regulatory, licensing, reporting, and legal obligations; costs and challenges associated with operating in markets in which we may have limited or no experience, including effectively localizing our products and services and adapting them to local preferences; difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences and in light of varying laws, regulations, and customs; differing employment practices and the existence of works councils; difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employees and maintaining our company culture; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; exchange control regulations; profit repatriation restrictions; potential tariffs, sanctions, fines, or other trade barriers or restrictions; import or export regulations; compliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery, anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations; the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions; and national or regional political, economic, or social instability. In addition, some countries have enacted or are considering data localization or residency laws, which require that certain data be maintained, stored and/or processed within their country of origin. Maintaining local data centers in individual countries could significantly increase our operating costs.\nOur international operations also may heighten many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Any violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that may apply to our international operations may result in lawsuits, enforcement actions, criminal actions, or sanctions against us and, our directors, officers, and employees; prohibit or require us to change our business practices; and damage our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These risks are inherent in our international operations, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could materially and adversely affect our business.\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could harm our business.\nAdverse global and regional economic conditions such as turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets, including, but not limited to, tightening in the credit markets, extreme volatility or distress in the financial markets (including the fixed\n25\nTable of Contents\nincome, credit, currency, equity, and commodity markets), unemployment, consumer debt levels, recessionary or inflationary pressures, supply chain issues, reduced consumer confidence or economic activity, government fiscal, monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international trade relationships, agreements, treaties, tariffs and restrictive actions, the inability of a government to enact a budget in a fiscal year, government shutdowns, government austerity programs, geopolitical conditions or events, and other negative financial news or macroeconomic developments could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our payments platform. Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets when needed due to volatility or illiquidity in the markets, liquidity needs due to unanticipated reductions in customer balances, or increased regulatory liquidity and capital requirements may strain our liquidity position. Such conditions may also expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or interest rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nIf our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur reputation and brands are globally recognized, important to our business, and affect our ability to attract and retain our customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. We may experience scrutiny or criticism from customers, partners, employees, government entities, media, advocacy groups, and other influencers or stakeholders that disagree with, among other things, our product offering decisions, internal policies, or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may result from, among other things, new features, products, services, operational efforts, or terms of service (or changes to the same), or our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or information security. The proliferation of social media may increase and compound the likelihood, speed, magnitude, and unpredictability of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, our business and operating results may be adversely impacted.\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our key metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nOur key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems, including systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require significant judgment.\nWe regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of our metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material. Further, as our business develops, we may revise or cease reporting metrics if we determine that such metrics are no longer appropriate measures of our performance. If investors, analysts, or customers do not consider our reported measures to be sufficient or to accurately reflect our business, we may receive negative publicity, our reputation may be harmed, and our business may be adversely impacted.\nEnvironmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) issues may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nVarious jurisdictions are adopting or considering new laws and regulations that expand mandatory disclosure, reporting and diligence requirements with respect to ESG matters. If we are unable to comply with new laws and regulations concerning ESG matters or fail to meet investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, our reputation may be harmed, customers may choose to refrain from using our products and services, we may be subject to fines, penalties, regulatory or other enforcement actions, and our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are viewed as incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to ESG-related goals on a timely basis or at all, we may be viewed negatively by stakeholders concerned about these matters. Moreover, investors, customers, partners, media, government entities, and other stakeholders (including those in support of or in opposition to ESG principles) may have a negative view of us to the extent we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to their ESG concerns or take positions that are contrary to their views or expectations.\nWe recognize that climate-related risks may impact our business. For example, California, where our headquarters are located, has historically experienced, and is projected to continue to experience, extreme weather and natural disaster events more frequently, including drought, flooding, heat waves, and wildfires. Such events may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience additional costs to maintain or resume operations.\n26\nTable of Contents\nIf one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail,we may incur significant losses.\nWe have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, receivables outstanding, and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and international jurisdictions. As part of our foreign exchange hedging activities, we regularly enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and other financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We regularly monitor our concentration of, and exposure to counterparty risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default on obligations by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. If one of our counterparty financial institutions were to become insolvent, placed into receivership, or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited, held in accounts with, or otherwise due from, such counterparty may be limited due to the insufficiency of the failed institutions\u2019 estate to satisfy all claims in full or the applicable laws or regulations governing the insolvency, bankruptcy, or resolution proceedings. In the event of default on obligations by, or the failure of, one or more of these counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable, or perceived as unable, to effectively manage customer funds, our business could be harmed.\nWe hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers, including balances in customer accounts and funds being remitted to sellers of goods and services or recipients of person-to-person transactions. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, we are required to comply with applicable regulatory requirements with respect to customer balances. Our success is reliant on public confidence in our ability to effectively manage our customers\u2019 balances and handle substantial transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to manage customer funds in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, or any public loss of confidence in us or our ability to effectively manage customer balances, could lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products or reduce customer balances held with us, which could significantly harm our business.\nThere are risks associated with our indebtedness.\nWe have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt. Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences, including the need to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other available cash to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, strategic investments, and share repurchases; the reduction of our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business, competitive pressures and market conditions; and limits on our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, strategic investments, share repurchases, or other general corporate purposes.\nOur revolving credit facilities and the indentures for our senior unsecured notes pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our business and operations. If we fail to pay amounts due under a debt instrument or breach any of its covenants, the lenders or noteholders would typically have the right to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder (subject in certain cases to a grace or cure period). Moreover, any such acceleration and required repayment of, or default in respect of, our indebtedness could, in turn, constitute an event of default under other debt instruments, thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of our indebtedness. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nChanges by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing costs. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rates payable by us under our indebtedness may increase, and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected.\nChanges in tax laws, exposure to unanticipated additional tax liabilities, or implementation of reporting or record-keeping obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn increasing number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and governments of foreign jurisdictions, such as the EU Commission, as well as international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), are focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. These actions may\n27\nTable of Contents\nmaterially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, net income, and cash flows.\nSpecifically, the OECD has published model rules and is coordinating negotiations among participating countries with the goal of achieving consensus on significant changes to international tax rules, including the implementation of a global minimum tax rate of 15%, commonly referred to as Pillar Two. Each individual jurisdiction will need to enact minimum tax legislation which may result in various interpretations of the OECD model rules and applicable timelines. Certain countries in which we do business have enacted implementing legislation effective January 1, 2024. As additional jurisdictions enact similar legislation, transition rules expire, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation become effective, our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years. The impact will depend on several factors including U.S and foreign tax legislation as well as our overall tax profile. A number of details around the provisions are still uncertain as the OECD and individual jurisdictions continue to issue guidance.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits, and reviews by tax authorities in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities that differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements, which may, individually or in the aggregate, materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.\nIn addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by changes in our geographical mix of income and impacts of statutory tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, including as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program; by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles; or by certain discrete items.\nA number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and foreign jurisdictions have implemented and may impose reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate e-commerce to improve tax compliance. A number of jurisdictions are also reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified our systems to meet applicable requirements and expect that further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements, which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions, and harm our business.\nWe may be unable to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business.\nCompetition for key and other highly skilled personnel is intense, especially for executive talent, software engineers, and other technology talent. We may be limited in our ability to recruit or hire internationally, including due to restrictive laws or policies on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled workers. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our inability to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain key and other highly qualified and diverse talent, whether in a remote or in-office environment, or protect the safety, health and productivity of our workforce could harm our overall business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services.\nWe may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through our online services by our customers and other third parties, including, but not limited to, claims alleging defamation, libel, harassment, hate speech, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services. We invest in measures intended to detect and block activities that may occur on our payments platform in violation of our policies and applicable laws. These measures require continuous improvement and may not be sufficiently effective in detecting and preventing the exchange of information in violation of our policies and applicable laws, which could negatively impact our business. If the laws or regulations that provide protections for online dissemination of information are invalidated, modified, or supplemented to reduce protections available to us, or to increase requirements on us to remove certain information or implement other processes, we could be harmed and may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our potential liability for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services. This increased risk could require us to expend substantial resources or discontinue certain product or service offerings, which could harm our business.\n28\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1B.

CYBERSECURITY\nCYBERSECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY\nOur Information Security Program is designed to support the Company in identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity threats and incidents (collectively, \u201ccybersecurity risks\u201d) with the intention to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information.\nWe design and regularly assess our Information Security Program guided by National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and ISO standards (including ISO 27001), proprietary controls and industry best practices.\nOur Information Security Program is built on a three lines of defense model integrated into our overall Enterprise Risk and Compliance Management Program (\u201cERCM Program\u201d).\nIt shares common methodologies, reporting channels, and governance processes that apply across the ERCM Program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas. The Program is governed by the Technology, Information Security, and Privacy Risk Management Committee and overseen by our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) and its Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (\u201cARC Committee\u201d).\nThe three lines of defense model is designed to provide a structure for risk management in the first line of defense (\u201cFLOD\u201d), monitoring and guidance by the second line of defense (\u201cSLOD\u201d), and independent audit by the third line of defense (\u201cTLOD\u201d). Our Office of the Chief Information Security Officer oversees the Company's information, cyber, and technology security. The Enterprise Risk Management Organization provides second line monitoring and guidance. The Technology and Information Security team serves as SLOD and provides independent oversight of our technology and cybersecurity risk mitigation practices and capabilities. As TLOD, Internal Audit independently assesses the effectiveness of our cybersecurity risk management and independently reports the results of audits to our ARC Committee to assist it in its oversight duties.\nOur Information Security Program includes:\n\u2022\nRisk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise Information Technology (\u201cIT\u201d) environment;\n\u2022\nRegular testing of our systems to identify and address potential vulnerabilities;\n\u2022\nIntegrated planning and preparedness activities supporting business continuity and operational resiliency;\n\u2022\nSecurity teams principally responsible for managing (1) our annual cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents;\n\u2022\nA cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents;\n\u2022\n24/7 monitoring and measurement of cybersecurity threats through our PayPal Cyber Defense Center (\u201cCDC\u201d);\n\u2022\nThe use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls;\n\u2022\nAn information training and awareness program for our employees, contractors, incident response personnel, and senior management; and\n\u2022\nA\nthird-party risk management\nframework designed to monitor and address risks from cybersecurity incidents of service providers, suppliers, and vendors that includes due diligence over third-party\u2019s information security and technology control environment at onboarding and periodically throughout the lifecycle of the relationship. In addition, our standard contractual terms require notification and communication from third parties in the event of a cybersecurity incident. We maintain procedures to respond to, manage and mitigate third-party cybersecurity events and vulnerabilities when identified.\nFor a description of risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d under the captions \u201c\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition\n\u201d and \u201c\nBusiness interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites, applications, products or services, or otherwise harm our business.\n\u201d\n29\nTable of Contents\nCYBERSECURITY GOVERNANCE\nOur Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to our ARC Committee oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks.\nThe ARC Committee oversees PayPal\u2019s overall risk framework, including management\u2019s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program, and reports to the full Board of Directors on a regular basis on cybersecurity and information technology risk management.\nThe ARC Committee receives periodic reports from the\nChief Information Security Officer (\u201cCISO\u201d)\non our cybersecurity risks. Management also updates the ARC Committee, as necessary, regarding cybersecurity incidents.\nOur CISO is responsible for implementing the information security strategy, security engineering, enabling business partners, and securing customer data, digital assets, and payments. His organization also monitors cyber regulation requirements and reviews impacts of new products and initiatives.\nOur CISO has over two decades of experience as a cybersecurity professional, including as a CISO at PayPal and four other organizations including leading global financial services institutions and large scale U.S. government agencies (including within the Department of Defense). He has an extensive record of success shepherding digital transformation aligned with business goals, launching cybersecurity frameworks, building security engineering teams, ensuring protection of assets, data, privacy, and company reputation.\nThe ARC Committee reports to the Board regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity risk oversight. The Board also receives briefings at least annually from management on our Information Security Program. Board members receive presentations on cybersecurity topics from our CISO and external experts from time to time as part of our continuing education to the Board on topics relevant to their service as a member of our Board.\nOur cybersecurity teams, overseen by our CISO, are responsible for assessing and managing our risks from cybersecurity threats, including defining security policy and board reporting of security risk. The CISO approves all security policies and oversees the identification, assessment, and management of cybersecurity risks, which provides a proactive and comprehensive approach to safeguarding our information assets. The teams have primary responsibility for our overall Information Security Program and supervise both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our external cybersecurity consultants. Our cybersecurity teams\u2019 experience includes cybersecurity incident response, in-depth security assessments, and security emulation exercises to evaluate security profile, security research, education and outreach, and security tool development.\nOur cybersecurity teams, in coordination with the CDC, supervise efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity threats and incidents through the operation of our incident response plan and various other means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel, threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us, as well as alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment. The CDC team oversees, identifies, and addresses security threats aimed at safeguarding PayPal employees, consumers, and merchants.\nITEM 2.

The actual number of stockholders is significantly greater than this number of record holders, and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees.\nDIVIDEND POLICY\nWe have never paid any cash dividends and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nSTOCK REPURCHASE ACTIVITY\nIn June 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $15.0\u00a0billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. In February 2025, our Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $15.0\u00a0billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. Our stock repurchase programs are intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count.\u00a0Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase agreements or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate, and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Moreover, any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d within our Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nTHE COMPANY\nAt PayPal, our mission is to revolutionize commerce globally. Our products are designed to enable digital payments and simplify commerce experiences for consumers and merchants to make selling, shopping, and sending and receiving money simple, personalized, and secure, online or offline, including mobile. Our two-sided platform serves millions of consumers and merchants worldwide.\nRegulatory environment\nWe operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including anti-money laundering, countering terrorist financing, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.\nCybersecurity and information security\nCybersecurity and information security risks for global payments and technology companies like us have increased significantly in recent years. Although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect the data we manage, prevent data loss and other security incidents, and enable us to effectively respond to known and potential risks, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cybersecurity incidents and remain subject to these risks. There can be no assurance that our security measures will provide sufficient protection or security to prevent breaches or attacks. For additional information regarding our cybersecurity and information security risks, see \u201cItem 1A.

As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.\n** Not meaningful.\nNet revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 7%, in 2024 compared to 2023 driven primarily by growth in total payment volume (\u201cTPV\u201d, as defined below under \u201cKey Metrics\u201d) of 10%.\nTotal operating expenses increased $1.7 billion, or 7%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to an increase in transaction expense, and to a lesser extent, restructuring and other, partially offset by a reduction in transaction and credit losses.\nOperating income increased $297 million, or 6%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due to net revenues increasing more than operating expenses. Our operating margin remained consistent at 17% for both 2024 and 2023.\nNet income decreased $99 million, or 2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due to the previously discussed increase in operating income of $297 million and a decrease of $379 million in other income (expense), net, driven primarily by net losses on strategic investments in the current period as compared to net gains on strategic investments in the prior period.\nIMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES\nWe have significant international operations that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar, subjecting us to foreign exchange risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or weakening of the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) dollar versus foreign currencies in which we conduct our international operations impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, we generated approximately 43%, 42%, and 43% of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the U.S., respectively. Because we generate substantial net revenues internationally, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the U.S., including those discussed under \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nWe calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our business using prior period foreign exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign currency exposure management program in which we use foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, intended to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues or operating expenses (as applicable) in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings.\n33\nTable of Contents\nIn the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, the year-over-year foreign exchange rate movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the following impact on our reported results:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\n(Unfavorable) favorable impact to net revenues (exclusive of hedging impact)\n$\n(18)\n$\n128\nHedging impact\n48\n111\nFavorable impact to net revenues\n30\n239\nFavorable (Unfavorable) impact to operating expense\n28\n(29)\nNet favorable impact to operating income\n$\n58\n$\n210\nWhile we enter into foreign exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements, it is impossible to eliminate the total effects of this exposure.\nWe also use foreign exchange contracts, designated as net investment hedges, to reduce the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. Gains and losses associated with these instruments will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated.\nGiven that we also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional balance sheet foreign currency exposure management program in which we use foreign exchange contracts to help offset the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.\u00a0The foreign exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts. These foreign exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.\nAdditionally, in connection with transactions occurring in multiple currencies on our payments platform, we generally set our foreign exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign exchange rates and when transactions occur. While we have processes in place to mitigate these risks, it is impossible to eliminate the total effects of any possible exposure associated with setting foreign exchange rates on our payments platform.\nKEY METRICS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS\nKEY METRICS\nTPV, number of payment transactions, active accounts, and number of payment transactions per active account are key non-financial performance metrics (\u201ckey metrics\u201d) that management uses to measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers, and are defined as follows:\n\u2022\nTPV\nis the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n\u2022\nNumber of payment transactions\nis the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n\u2022\nAn\nactive account\nis an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal\u2019s platform or services through such third-party\u2019s login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet\u2019s payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results.\n34\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nNumber of payment transactions per active account\nreflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month period, divided by active accounts at the end of the period. The number of payment transactions per active account provides management with insight into the average number of times an account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period. The number of times a consumer account or a merchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of payment transactions per active account.\nAs our transaction revenue is typically correlated with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments platform, management uses these metrics to gain insights into the scale and strength of our payments platform, the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and trends which may be indicators of current and future performance. We present these key metrics to enhance investors\u2019 evaluation of the performance of our business and operating results.\nOur key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems, including systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require significant judgment.\nWe regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of our metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes, and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material.\nNET REVENUES\nOur revenues are classified into the following two categories:\n\u2022\nTransaction revenues\n:\nNet transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis based on the TPV completed on our payments platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform. We generate additional revenue from merchants and consumers: on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees.\n\u2022\nRevenues from other value added services:\nNet revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our consumers and merchants. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\nOur revenues can be significantly impacted by a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nThe mix of merchants, products, and services;\n\u2022\nThe mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;\n\u2022\nThe geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and\n\u2022\nThe amount of our loans receivable outstanding with consumers and merchants.\nRefer to \u201cPart I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K for further discussion on factors that may impact our revenue.\n35\nTable of Contents\nNet revenue analysis\nThe components of our net revenues for the years ended December\u00a031, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nTransaction revenues\nTransaction revenues grew $2.0 billion, or 7%, in 2024 compared to 2023 driven primarily by an increase in revenues of approximately $1.3 billion, $0.5 billion, and $0.2 billion from our Braintree, core PayPal, and Venmo products and services, respectively, which resulted from growth in TPV and the number of payment transactions.\nAs a result of ongoing negotiations with merchants, including our stronger focus on profitable growth, we expect lower volume and transaction revenue growth from our Braintree offerings in 2025.\nThe graphs below present the respective key metrics (in millions) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:\n*Reflects active accounts at the end of the applicable period.\nThe following table provides a summary of related metrics:\nYear Ended December 31,\nPercent\u00a0Increase/\n(Decrease)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\nNumber of payment transactions per active account\n60.6\n58.7\n51.4\n3\n%\n14\n%\nPercent of cross-border TPV\n(1)\n12\n%\n12\n%\n13\n%\n**\n**\n(1)\nCross-border TPV occurs primarily between two PayPal accounts in different countries and includes transactions initiated through our Xoom product.\n** Not meaningful.\nWe had active accounts of 434 million and 426 million as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 2%. Number of payment transactions was 26.3 billion and 25.0 billion for the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 5%. TPV was $1.68 trillion and $1.53 trillion for the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 10%.\n36\nTable of Contents\nTransaction revenues growth was lower than the growth in TPV in 2024 due primarily to changes in mix from core PayPal products and services with a higher volume from large merchants, which have lower pricing.\nRevenues from other value added services\nRevenues from other value added services increased $41 million, or 1%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to an approximately $380 million increase in interest earned on certain assets underlying customer account balances resulting from higher interest rates and higher customer balances, partially offset by a decline in the revenue of approximately $160 million earned from an independent chartered financial institution (\u201cpartner institution\u201d). Revenue from the partner institution is earned primarily through our revenue share associated with our U.S. revolving consumer credit product and PayPal and Venmo branded credit cards. Revenues from other value added services were also impacted by an approximately $180 million decline from: lower interest and fee revenue on our PayPal Business Loan (\u201cPPBL\u201d) products, lower revenues from Honey, and lower revenues resulting from the sale of Happy Returns in the forth quarter of 2023.\nConsumers that have outstanding loans and interest receivable due to our partner institution may experience hardships that result in losses recognized by the partner institution, which may result in a decrease in our revenue share earned in future periods. In the event the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs funded by the partner institution does not meet a minimum rate of return (\u201cminimum return threshold\u201d) in a particular quarter, our revenue share for that period would be zero. Further, in the event the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs managed by the partner institution does not meet the minimum return threshold as measured over four consecutive quarters and in the following quarter, we would be required to make a payment to the partner institution, subject to certain limitations. Through December\u00a031, 2024, the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs funded by the partner institution exceeded the minimum return threshold.\nSeasonality\nThe Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2024, 2023, or 2022 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nThe following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trends in each:\nYear Ended December 31,\nPercent\u00a0Increase/\n(Decrease)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nTransaction expense\n$\n15,697\n$\n14,385\n$\n12,173\n9\n%\n18\n%\nTransaction and credit losses\n1,442\n1,682\n1,572\n(14)\n%\n7\n%\nCustomer support and operations\n1,768\n1,919\n2,120\n(8)\n%\n(9)\n%\nSales and marketing\n2,001\n1,809\n2,257\n11\n%\n(20)\n%\nTechnology and development\n2,979\n2,973\n3,253\n\u2014\n%\n(9)\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n2,147\n2,059\n2,099\n4\n%\n(2)\n%\nRestructuring and other\n438\n(84)\n207\n**\n(141)\n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n26,472\n$\n24,743\n$\n23,681\n7\n%\n4\n%\nTransaction expense rate\n(1)\n0.93\n%\n0.94\n%\n0.90\n%\n**\n**\nTransaction and credit loss rate\n(2)\n0.09\n%\n0.11\n%\n0.12\n%\n**\n**\n(1)\nTransaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by TPV.\n(2)\nTransaction and credit loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and credit losses by TPV.\n**\nNot meaningful.\n37\nTable of Contents\nTransaction expense\nTransaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer\u2019s funding source of payment. These costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions when we draw funds from a customer\u2019s credit or debit card, bank account, or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet. We refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our \u201cfunding mix.\u201d The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal or Venmo account balance or our consumer credit products. As we expand the availability and presentation of alternative funding sources to our customers, our funding mix may change, which could increase or decrease our transaction expense rate. The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs, as we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit or debit cards outside the U.S. Our transaction expense rate is impacted by changes in product mix, merchant mix, regional mix, funding mix, and fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions. Macroeconomic environment changes may also result in behavioral shifts in consumer spending patterns affecting the type of funding source they use, which could also impact the funding mix.\nTransaction expense increased $1.3 billion, or 9%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due to Braintree, which has a higher expense rate than our other products and services, representing a larger portion of TPV. The decrease in transaction expense rate in 2024 compared to 2023 was attributable to favorable changes in regional mix, product mix, and certain third-party pricing incentives within our core PayPal products and services. For the years ended December\u00a031, 2024, 2023, and 2022, approximately 37%, 36%, and 35% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of the U.S.\nTransaction and credit losses\nTransaction losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks. Credit losses include the current expected credit losses associated with our consumer and merchant loans receivable portfolio. Our transaction and credit losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including TPV, product mix, current and projected macroeconomic conditions such as unemployment rates, retail e-commerce sales and household disposable income, merchant insolvency events, changes to and usage of our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchants. Estimating our current expected credit loss allowances for our loans receivable portfolios is an inherently uncertain process and the ultimate losses we incur may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the ultimate losses incurred. A deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or other factors beyond those considered in our estimates could result in credit losses that exceed our current estimated credit losses and adversely impact our future operating results.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe components of our transaction and credit losses for the years ended December\u00a031, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nTransaction and credit losses decreased $240 million, or 14%, in 2024 compared to 2023.\nTransaction losses were approximately $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion for 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $78 million, or 7%. Transaction loss rate (transaction losses divided by TPV) was 0.07%, 0.08%, and 0.09% for the years ended December\u00a031, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The decrease in transaction losses and the associated transaction loss rate in 2024 was primarily due to lower losses from our Venmo products and services resulting from enhanced risk mitigation strategies.\nCredit losses decreased $162 million in 2024 compared to 2023. The components of credit losses for the years ended December\u00a031, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(3)\n2022\nNet charge-offs\n(1)\n$\n372\n$\n549\n$\n267\nReserve (release) build\n(2)\n(44)\n(59)\n135\nCredit losses\n$\n328\n$\n490\n$\n402\n(1)\nNet charge-offs includes principal charge-offs partially offset by recoveries for consumer and merchant receivables.\n(2)\nReserve (release) build represents change in allowance for principal receivables excluding foreign currency remeasurement.\n(3)\nIncludes changes in the allowance due to the reclassification of loans and interest receivable to or from held for sale.\nCredit losses in the year ended December\u00a031, 2024 were primarily attributable to loan originations during the period partially offset by improvement in the credit quality of loans outstanding. Credit losses in the year ended December\u00a031, 2023 were primarily attributable to loan originations during the period and a deterioration in the credit quality of loans outstanding.\nConsumer loan portfolio\nIn June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) and other European buy now, pay later loan receivables, consisting of eligible loans and interest receivables, including a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans over a 24-month commitment period (collectively, \u201celigible consumer installment receivables\u201d). In December 2024, this agreement was amended and restated to extend the commitment period to December 2026 and to increase the maximum balance of loans that can be sold at a time. For additional information, see \u201cNote 1\u2014Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, loans and interest receivable, held for sale was $541 million and $563 million, respectively.\n39\nTable of Contents\nThe consumer loans and interest receivable balance as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023 was $5.4 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, net of participation interest sold, reflecting an increase of 13%. The increase was driven primarily by growth of approximately $390 million and $250 million in our installment credit products driven by growth in Japan and the U.S., respectively, as well as growth of approximately $170 million in our revolving credit product in the U.K., partially offset by a decline of approximately $180 million in our installment credit products in Germany due to the forward-flow arrangement with the global investment firm.\nThe following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our consumer loans and interest receivable balance:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nPercent of consumer loans and interest receivable current\n96.6\n%\n95.4\n%\nPercent of consumer loans and interest receivable > 90 days outstanding\n(1)\n1.6\n%\n2.2\n%\nNet charge-off rate\n(2)\n4.5\n%\n7.2\n%\n(1)\nRepresents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date or contractual repayment date, as applicable.\n(2)\nNet charge-off rate is the annualized ratio of net credit losses during the three months ended December\u00a031, 2024, excluding fraud losses, on consumer loans as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivable balance during the same period.\nThe decline in net charge-off rate for consumer receivables at December\u00a031, 2024 as compared to December\u00a031, 2023 was due primarily to the improvement in credit quality of the U.S. interest-bearing installment products.\nIn response to changing portfolio performance and macroeconomic environment, we continue to monitor risk and evaluate and modify our acceptable risk parameters. Changes to such parameters in 2024 resulted in an increase of U.S. interest-bearing installment loan originations in 2024.\nMerchant loan portfolio\nWe offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses, which we refer to as our merchant finance offerings. Total merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable outstanding, net of participation interest sold, as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023 was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, reflecting an increase of 23%. The increase was due primarily to growth of approximately $170 million in our PayPal Working Capital (\u201cPPWC\u201d) product portfolio, primarily from the U.S., Germany and the U.K., as well as growth of approximately $110 million in our PPBL product in the U.S.\nThe following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable balance:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nPercent of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable current\n90.4\n%\n87.0\n%\nPercent of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable > 90 days outstanding\n(1)\n2.8\n%\n5.6\n%\nNet charge-off rate\n(2)\n5.3\n%\n18.8\n%\n(1)\nRepresents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the original expected or contractual repayment period, as applicable.\n(2)\nNet charge-off rate is the annualized ratio of net credit losses during the three months ended December\u00a031, 2024, excluding fraud losses, on merchant loans and advances as a percentage of the average daily amount of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable balance during the same period.\nThe increase in the percent of current merchant receivables and decrease in percent of merchant receivables greater than 90 days outstanding and the net charge-off rate for merchant receivables at December\u00a031, 2024 as compared to December\u00a031, 2023 was due primarily to the improvement in underwriting and credit quality of the PPBL portfolio.\nIn response to changing portfolio performance and macroeconomic environment, we continue to monitor risk and evaluate and modify our acceptable risk parameters. Changes to such parameters resulted in an increase in PPBL originations in 2024.\nFor additional information, see \u201cNote 11\u2014Loans and Interest Receivable\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014\nOur credit products expose us to additional risks\n\u201d included in this Form 10-K.\n40\nTable of Contents\nCustomer support and operations\nCustomer support and operations includes costs incurred in our global customer operations centers, including costs to provide call support to our customers, costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our consumers and merchants, and other costs incurred related to the delivery of our products, including payment devices, card production, and customer onboarding and compliance costs.\nCustomer support and operations expenses decreased $151 million, or 8%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to a decline in employee-related costs of approximately $100 million associated with a headcount reduction. The decline in customer support and operations expenses year-over-year was also impacted by a reduction in other costs incurred related to delivery of our products, including warehouses, shipping, and payment devices and a decrease in contractors and consulting costs, partially offset by an increase in customer onboarding and compliance costs and card issuance costs.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing includes costs incurred for customer acquisition, business development, advertising, and marketing programs.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $192 million, or 11%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to higher spend of approximately $260 million on marketing and brand advertising, including the launch of our PayPal Everywhere advertising campaign, partially offset by a decline in employee-related costs.\n41\nTable of Contents\nTechnology and development\nTechnology and development includes costs incurred in connection with the development of our payments platform, new products, and the improvement of our existing products, including the amortization of software and website development costs incurred in developing our payments platform, which are capitalized. It also includes acquired developed technology and our site operations and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our payments platform.\nTechnology and development expenses remained consistent in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to a decline in employee-related costs associated with headcount reduction offset by an increase in costs related to contractors and consultants and software maintenance costs.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative includes costs incurred to provide support to our business, including legal, human resources, finance, risk and compliance, executive, and other support operations.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $88 million, or 4%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to an increase in professional services expense, a contingency reserve, and indirect tax expense, partially offset by a decline in depreciation expense and facilities costs.\nRestructuring and other\nRestructuring and other primarily consist of restructuring expenses, asset impairment charges, gain on sale of divested business, and losses on loans and interest receivable, held for sale.\n42\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring and other increased $522 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily resulting from restructuring charges and fair value adjustments on loans and interest receivable, held for sale and a gain on sale of a divested business, in which we recorded a pre-tax gain of $339\u00a0million in 2023 with no comparable activity in the current period.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to streamline operations, focus resources on core strategic priorities, and improve our cost structure. The associated restructuring charges during the year ended December\u00a031, 2024 were $307 million and included employee severance and benefits costs and stock-based compensation expense, which were substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2024. The estimated reduction in annualized employee-related costs associated with the impacted workforce is approximately $575 million, including approximately $165 million in stock-based compensation. We reinvested a portion of the reduction in annual costs associated with the impacted workforce to drive business priorities.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to focus resources on core strategic priorities, and improve our cost structure and operating efficiency. The associated restructuring charges during the year ended December\u00a031, 2023 were $122 million. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, which were substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nFor information on the associated restructuring liabilities, see \u201cNote 17\u2014Restructuring and Other\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWe continue to review our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We incurred asset impairment charges of nil and $61 million in the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to exiting certain leased properties, which resulted in a reduction of right-of-use lease assets and related leasehold improvements.\nIn the year ended December\u00a031, 2023, we recognized a gain of $17\u00a0million due to the sale of an owned property. We also incurred a loss of $14\u00a0million related to another owned property, which was previously held for sale, in the year ended December\u00a031, 2023.\nDuring the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, approximately $129\u00a0million and $74\u00a0million of losses were recorded in restructuring and other, which included net loss on sale of loans and interest receivable previously held for sale (inclusive of transaction costs) and fair value adjustments to measure loans and interest receivable, held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net of $4 million in 2024 decreased $379 million compared to $383 million in 2023. This decline in other income (expense), net was due primarily to net losses and impairments on strategic investments in the current period compared to net gains in the prior period, which contributed a decline of approximately $490 million year-over-year, partially offset by an increase in interest income of approximately $180 million resulting from an increase in average cash balances and interest rates year-over-year.\nIncome tax expense\nOur effective income tax rate was 22% in both 2024 and 2023. Our effective income tax rate in 2024 remained consistent compared to 2023 and was impacted primarily by changes in jurisdictional mix of income, U.S. income taxed at different rates, discrete tax adjustments, and tax expense in prior period associated with sale of a divested business. See \u201cNote 16\u2014Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information on our effective tax rate.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, including our customer protection programs, credit products, capital expenditures, investments in our business, potential acquisitions and strategic investments, working capital, and other cash needs. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access to capital markets, together with potential external funding through third-party sources, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements within the next 12 months and beyond.\n43\nTable of Contents\nSOURCES OF LIQUIDITY\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments\nThe following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments\n(1)(2)\n$\n13,846\n$\n15,493\n(1)\nExcludes assets related to funds receivable and customer accounts of $37.7 billion and $38.9 billion as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(2)\nExcludes total restricted cash of $1 million and $3 million at December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and strategic investments of\n$1.6 billion and $1.8\u00a0billion at December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were $8.5 billion at December\u00a031, 2024 and $10.0\u00a0billion at December\u00a031, 2023, or 62% and 64%, of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of those respective dates. At December\u00a031, 2024, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to U.S. taxation under Subpart F, Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) or the one-time transition tax under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTax Act\u201d). Subsequent repatriations to the U.S. will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective except for any tax on foreign exchange gains and losses; however, they may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax.\nA significant aspect of our global cash management activities involves meeting our customers\u2019 requirements to access their cash while simultaneously meeting our regulatory financial ratio commitments in various jurisdictions. Our global cash balances are required not only to provide operational liquidity to our businesses, but also to support our global regulatory requirements across our regulated subsidiaries. Accordingly, not all of our cash is available for general corporate purposes.\nCash flows\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n7,450\n$\n4,843\n$\n5,813\nInvesting activities\n1,589\n752\n(3,328)\nFinancing activities\n(8,276)\n(2,993)\n(1,203)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n(207)\n76\n(155)\nNet change  in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n556\n$\n2,678\n$\n1,127\nOperating activities\nCash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, timing differences between expenses recognized for provision for transaction and credit losses and actual cash transaction losses incurred, originations and proceeds from repayments and sales of loans and interest receivable held for sale, and changes in other assets and liabilities. Significant non-cash expenses for the period include depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. The cash impact from actual transaction losses incurred during a period is reflected as changes in other assets and liabilities. The expenses recognized during the period for provision for credit losses are estimates of current expected credit losses on our consumer and merchant credit products. Actual charge-offs of receivables related to our consumer and merchant credit products have no impact on cash from operating activities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities grew $2.6 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to changes in deferred taxes of approximately $900 million, changes in working capital of approximately $760 million, an increase of approximately $530 million in sales and repayments of loans receivable held for sale, net of originations, and an impact of approximately $490 million from losses on strategic investments.\nCash paid for income taxes, net in 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $1.0 billion, $2.1 billion, and $878 million, respectively.\n44\nTable of Contents\nInvesting activities\nCash flows from investing activities includes purchases, maturities and sales of investments; cash paid for acquisitions and strategic investments; purchases and sales of property and equipment; purchases, originations, sales, and principal repayment of loans receivable, originally classified as held for investment; changes in funds receivable; changes in collateral posted related to derivative instruments, net; and purchases and maturities of reverse repurchase agreements.\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased $837 million in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to an increase of $5.9 billion from changes related to funds receivable, partially offset by a decrease of $3.0 billion in sales and repayments of loans receivables, net of purchases and originations, and an increase of $1.6 billion in purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities.\nFinancing activities\nCash flows from financing activities includes proceeds from issuance of common stock, purchases of treasury stock, tax withholdings related to net share settlements of equity awards, borrowings and repayments under financing arrangements, changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers, changes in collateral received related to derivative instruments, net, and borrowings and repayments under repurchase agreements.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $5.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to a decrease of $3.8 billion from changes related to funds payable and amounts due to customers, an increase of $1.0 billion in share repurchases of our common stock, and an increase of approximately $590 million in repayments, net of borrowings under financing arrangements.\nEffect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\nForeign exchange rates had a negative impact of $207 million and positive impact of $76 million on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash during 2024 and 2023, respectively. The negative impact in 2024 was primarily due to unfavorable fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Australian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the British pound and Euro. The positive impact in 2023 was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the British pound.\nAvailable credit and debt\nIn June 2023, we entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) that provides for an unsecured $5.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement includes a $150\u00a0million letter of credit sub-facility and a $600 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. As of December\u00a031, 2024, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement and as such, $5.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.\nIn February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cPaidy Credit Agreement\u201d) with Paidy as co-borrower, which provided for an unsecured revolving credit facility of \u00a560.0\u00a0billion, which was modified in September 2022 to increase the borrowing capacity by \u00a530.0\u00a0billion for a total borrowing capacity of \u00a590.0\u00a0billion (approximately $574\u00a0million as of December\u00a031, 2024). In the year ended December\u00a031, 2024, \u00a590.0\u00a0billion (approximately $574 million) was drawn down under the Paidy Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December\u00a031, 2024, no borrowing capacity was available under the Paidy Credit Agreement.\nWe maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world with a borrowing capacity of approximately $80 million in the aggregate, where we can withdraw and utilize the funds at our discretion for general corporate purposes. As of December\u00a031, 2024, substantially all of the borrowing capacity under these credit facilities was available, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.\nIn May 2024, June 2023, May 2022, May 2020 and September 2019, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates  (collectively referred to as the \u201cNotes\u201d). Proceeds from the issuance of these Notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding the repayment or redemption of outstanding debt, share repurchases, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, and possible acquisitions of businesses, assets, or strategic investments. As of December\u00a031, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of $10.6 billion in fixed rate debt outstanding with varying maturity dates.\nFor additional information, see \u201cNote\u00a012\u2014Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\n45\nTable of Contents\nDepending on market conditions, we may from time to time issue debt, including in private or public offerings, to fund our operating activities, finance acquisitions, make strategic investments, repurchase shares under our stock repurchase program, or reduce our cost of capital.\nCredit ratings\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024, we continue to be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor\u2019s Financial Services, LLC, Fitch Ratings, Inc., and Moody\u2019s Investors Services, Inc. We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure and results of operations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on borrowings under our credit agreements.\nCURRENT AND FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS\nOur material cash requirements include funds to support current and potential: operating activities, credit products, customer protection programs, stock repurchases, strategic investments, acquisitions, other commitments, capital expenditures, and other future obligations.\nCredit products\nGrowth in our portfolio of loans receivable increases our liquidity needs, and any inability to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We continue to evaluate partnerships and third-party sources of funding for our credit products.\nThe Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the \u201cCSSF\u201d) has agreed that PayPal\u2019s management may designate up to 50% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund European, U.K., and U.S. credit activities. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, the cumulative amount approved by PayPal to be designated to fund credit activities was $2.0 billion and $3.0\u00a0billion, respectively, and represented approximately 26% and 39% of European customer balances made available for our corporate use as of those respective dates, as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to change the designation of amounts of European customer balances for our credit activities, as we deem necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. Under certain exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances.\nIn June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell our eligible consumer installment receivables portfolio. In December 2024, this agreement was amended and restated to extend the commitment period to December 2026 and to increase the maximum balance of loans that can be sold at a time. During the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, we sold $20.8\u00a0billion and $5.5\u00a0billion, respectively, of loans and interest receivable in connection with this agreement. For additional information, see \u201cNote 1\u2014Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWhile our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal.\nCustomer protection programs\nThe risk of losses from our customer protection programs are specific to individual consumers, merchants, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements. For the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements included in this report, our transaction loss rate ranged between 0.07% and 0.09% of TPV. Historical loss rates may not be indicative of future results.\nStock repurchases\nDuring the year ended December\u00a031, 2024, we repurchased approximately $6.0\u00a0billion of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in June 2022. As of\u00a0December\u00a031, 2024, a total of approximately $4.9\u00a0billion\u00a0remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our June 2022 stock repurchase program. For additional information, see \u201cNote\u00a014\u2014Stock Repurchase Programs\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\n46\nTable of Contents\nFuture obligations\nWe have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from our estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes our obligations as of December\u00a031, 2024 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations.\nPurchase\nObligations\nLeases\nTransition Tax\nLong-term Debt\nTotal\nPayments\u00a0Due\u00a0During\u00a0the\u00a0Year\u00a0Ending\u00a0December\u00a031,\n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n849\n$\n171\n354\n$\n1,542\n$\n2,916\n2026\n578\n177\n\u2014\n1,738\n2,493\n2027\n131\n159\n\u2014\n797\n1,087\n2028\n11\n109\n\u2014\n522\n642\n2029\n3\n88\n\u2014\n1,785\n1,876\nThereafter\n5\n198\n\u2014\n9,263\n9,466\n$\n1,577\n$\n902\n$\n354\n$\n15,647\n$\n18,480\nThe significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:\n\u2022\nPurchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for cloud computing services, advertising, and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.\n\u2022\nLease amounts include primarily minimum rental payments under our non-cancelable operating leases primarily for office and data center facilities. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.\n\u2022\nTransition tax represents the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Act.\n\u2022\nLong-term debt amounts represent the future principal and interest payments (based on contractual interest rates) on our fixed-rate debt. For more information, see \u201cNote\u00a012\u2014Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nAs we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table above does not include $2.6 billion recorded in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December\u00a031, 2024.\nOther considerations\nOur liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance, and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and \u201cNote 13\u2014Commitments and Contingencies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional discussion of these and other risks that our business faces.\n47\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate or assumption is considered critical if both (a)\u00a0the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b)\u00a0the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit, Risk, and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in \u201cNote 1\n\u2014\nOverview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10\n\u2011\nK.\nA quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated, and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general directional cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management\u2019s predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and such estimates require regular review and adjustment.\nALLOWANCE FOR TRANSACTION AND CREDIT LOSSES\nTransaction and credit losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, chargebacks, and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances. Our transaction and credit losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including: total TPV, product mix, current and projected macroeconomic conditions, merchant insolvency events, changes to and usage of our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products, which include revolving and installment credit products offered to consumers at checkout, as well as merchant loans and advances arising from the PPWC and PPBL products.\nWe establish allowances for negative customer balances and estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased items, purchase protection program claims, account takeovers, and bank returns and reversals. Additions to the allowance, in the form of provisions, are reflected in transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss). The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including experience with similar cases, historical trends involving collection and write-off patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types, as well as current and projected macroeconomic factors, as appropriate.\nWe also establish an allowance for loans and interest receivable, which represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and interest receivable and includes expected credit losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Determining appropriate current expected credit loss allowances for loans and interest receivable is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for current expected credit losses at the balance sheet date after incorporating the impact of externally sourced macroeconomic forecasts. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, we utilized externally published projections of forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, forecasted U.S. and U.K. retail e-commerce sales, and forecasted U.K. household disposable income, among others, over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The overall principal and interest coverage ratio as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 7% and 9%, respectively. A significant change in the forecasted macroeconomic factors could result in a material change in our allowances. An increase of 1% in the principal and interest coverage ratio would increase our allowances by approximately $69 million based on the loans and interest receivable balance outstanding as of December\u00a031, 2024.\n48\nTable of Contents\nACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES\nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the U.S. through provisions such as the GILTI tax and base erosion anti-abuse tax.\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and long-range business forecasts. To the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized, we record a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with U.S. GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. U.S. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nWe file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest and penalties, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.\nBased on our results for the year ended December\u00a031, 2024, an increase in our income tax expense of $53 million would have resulted in a one-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate.\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES\nWe are regularly involved in various claims, regulatory and legal proceedings, and investigations of potential violations by regulatory oversight authorities. On a regular basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, legal proceeding, or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective and are based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses, and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims, litigation, or other violations and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may differ materially from the actual outcomes.\n49\nTable of Contents\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nApplication of the accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants. Evaluating whether these incentives are a payment to a customer, or consideration payable on behalf of a customer, requires judgment. Incentives determined to be made to a customer, or payable on behalf of a customer, are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. Incentives that are earned by the customer based on performance targets are recorded when earned, based on management\u2019s estimate of each customer\u2019s future performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual customer performance, amendments to existing contracts, or the execution of new contracts. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized.\nEVALUATION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT\nWe have strategic investments in non-marketable equity securities, which include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer (the Measurement Alternative). We review these investments regularly to determine if impairment has occurred. We assess whether an impairment loss on these non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies, has occurred based on qualitative factors such as the companies\u2019 financial condition and business outlook, industry performance, regulatory, economic or technological environment, and other relevant events and factors affecting the company. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of these non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach. If any impairment is identified, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others. For sensitivity analysis performed on our strategic investments, see \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u2014\nEquity Investment Risk\n.\u201d\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity investment risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing, funding, and foreign exchange derivative activities intended to mitigate market risks. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, approximately 47% and 59%, respectively, of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investment portfolio (excluding restricted cash and strategic investments) was held in cash and cash equivalents.\nThe remaining portfolio and assets underlying the customer balances that we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, and available-for-sale debt securities. We seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in certain jurisdictions where we operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due to customers.\nInterest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, and available-for-sale debt securities and the fair value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities investment by approximately $101 million and $122 million at December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities resulting from such interest rate changes are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) and are realized only if we sell the securities prior to their scheduled maturities or the declines in fair values are due to expected credit losses.\n50\nTable of Contents\nAs of both December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, we had an aggregate principal amount of $10.6 billion in fixed rate debt with varying maturity dates. Since these notes bear interest at fixed rates, they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change, increasing in periods of declining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates.\nAs of both December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, we also had revolving credit facilities of approximately $5.6 billion available to us. We are obligated to pay interest on borrowings under these facilities as well as other customary fees, including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating. Borrowings under these facilities, if any, bear interest at floating rates. As a result, we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, \u00a590.0\u00a0billion (approximately $574 million) and \u00a550.0\u00a0billion (approximately $355\u00a0million), respectively, was outstanding under these facilities. A 100 basis points hypothetical adverse change in applicable market interest rates would not have resulted in a material impact to interest expense recorded in the period. For additional information, see \u201cNote 12\u2014Debt\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nInterest rates may also adversely impact our customers\u2019 spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to larger payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us, or to lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce our customers\u2019 ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs, and allowances for loans and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our net income (loss).\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK\nWe have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar, which subject us to foreign exchange risk and may adversely impact our financial results. We transact in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and expenses. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results of operations, and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities. We are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) dollar, and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies. We considered the historical trends in foreign exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term.\nWe have a foreign currency exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures, and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign exchange contracts. These foreign exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional details related to our foreign exchange contracts, please see \u201cNote 10\u2014Derivative Instruments\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWe use foreign exchange contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings and our investment in foreign subsidiaries from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies and net investment hedges for accounting purposes. The derivative\u2019s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI. Cash flow hedges are subsequently reclassified into revenue or expense in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The accumulated gains and losses associated with net investment hedges will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point they will be reclassified into earnings.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by a hypothetical 10% at December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $380 million and $622 million lower, respectively, before considering the offsetting impact of the underlying hedged item.\nWe have an additional balance sheet foreign currency management program in which we use foreign exchange contracts to help offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts.\n51\nTable of Contents\nAdverse changes in exchange rates of a hypothetical 10% for all foreign currencies would have resulted in a negative impact on income before income taxes of approximately $470 million and $417 million at December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively, without considering the offsetting effect of foreign exchange contracts. Foreign exchange contracts in place as of December\u00a031, 2024 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $445 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $25 million. Foreign exchange contracts in place as of December\u00a031, 2023 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $400 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $17 million. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% were applied to monetary assets, monetary liabilities, and available-for-sale debt securities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.\nEQUITY INVESTMENT RISK\nOur strategic investments are subject to a variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of the portfolio. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, our strategic investments totaled $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion which represented approximately 10% and 11% of our total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investment portfolio at those respective dates. Our strategic investments include marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies. We are required to record all adjustments to the value of these strategic investments through our consolidated statements of income (loss). As such, we expect volatility to our net income (loss) in future periods due to changes in observable prices and impairment related to our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative. These changes could be material based on market conditions. Additionally, the financial success of our investments in privately held companies is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition, private sale, or other favorable market event providing the ability to realize appreciation in the value of the investment. A hypothetical adverse change of 10% in the carrying value of our strategic investments as of December\u00a031, 2024, which could be experienced in the near term, would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $156 million to the carrying value of the portfolio. We review our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent purchases and sales of securities, and other publicly available data, for which we assess factors such as the investees\u2019 financial condition and business outlook, industry performance, regulatory, economic, or technological environment, and other relevant events and factors affecting the investees.\nITEM 8.

We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n56\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for Consumer Loans Receivable\nAs described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the total allowance for loans and interest receivable was $461 million as of December 31, 2024, of which $341 million relates to consumer loans receivable. The allowance for consumer loans receivable is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data and incorporates macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. The consumer loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region, loan term, delinquency, credit rating, vintage, and for the revolving credit portfolio, macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales. The forecasted macroeconomic factors are sourced externally, using a single scenario to reflect the economic conditions applicable to a particular period.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for consumer loans receivable is a critical audit matter are (i) a high degree of auditor subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to certain consumer loss models, and for the revolving credit portfolio, forecasted macroeconomic factors related to household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales used to estimate expected credit losses; and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for consumer loans receivable, including controls over certain consumer loss models, and for the revolving credit portfolio, forecasted macroeconomic factors related to household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales used to estimate expected credit losses. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management\u2019s process for determining the allowance for consumer loans receivable; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of certain data used in the estimate; and (iii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (a) the appropriateness of certain methodologies and consumer loss models used by management and (b) for the revolving credit portfolio, the reasonableness of forecasted macroeconomic factors related to household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 4, 2025\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2000.\n57\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE\u00a01\u2014\nOVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOVERVIEW AND ORGANIZATION\nPayPal Holdings, Inc. (\u201cPayPal,\u201d the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015. At PayPal, our mission is to revolutionize commerce globally. Our products are designed to enable digital payments and simplify commerce experiences for consumers and merchants to make selling, shopping, and sending and receiving money simple, personalized, secure, online or offline, including mobile. Our two-sided platform serves millions of consumers and merchants worldwide.\nWe operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including anti-money laundering, countering terrorist financing, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of presentation and principles of consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of PayPal and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nInvestments in entities where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For such investments, our share of the investee\u2019s results of operations is included in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss).\u00a0Investments in entities where we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for at fair value or cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes, which are included in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Our investment balances are included in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe determine at the inception of each investment, and re-evaluate if certain events occur, whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered a variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d). If we determine an investment is in a VIE, we then assess if we are the primary beneficiary, which would require consolidation. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and December\u00a031, 2023,\nno\nVIEs qualified for consolidation as the structures of these entities do not provide us with the ability to direct activities that would significantly impact their economic performance. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and December\u00a031, 2023, the carrying value of our investments in nonconsolidated VIEs was $\n187\nmillion and $\n175\nmillion, respectively, and is included as non-marketable equity securities applying the equity method of accounting in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets. The investments in nonconsolidated VIEs are primarily investments in funds that are limited partnerships or similar structures which are focused on increasing access to capital for underserved communities. Our maximum exposure to loss related to our nonconsolidated VIEs, which represents funded commitments and any future funding commitments, was $\n246\nmillion as of both December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023.\nCertain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation as of and for the year ended December\u00a031, 2024.\n64\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to provisions for transaction and credit losses, income taxes, loss contingencies, revenue recognition, and the evaluation of strategic investments for impairment. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased and are comprised of primarily bank deposits, government and agency securities, and commercial paper.\nInvestments\nShort-term investments include time deposits and available-for-sale debt securities with original maturities of greater than three months but less than one year when purchased or maturities of one year or less on the reporting date. Long-term investments include time deposits and available-for-sale debt securities with maturities exceeding one year on the reporting date, as well as our strategic investments. Our available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of related estimated tax provisions or benefits.\nWe elect to account for available-for-sale debt securities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, underlying funds receivable and customer accounts, short-term investments, and long-term investments, under the fair value option as further discussed in \u201cNote 9\u2014Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities.\u201d The changes in fair value related to initial measurement and subsequent changes in fair value are included as a component of other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss).\nOur strategic investments consist of marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies. Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity securities include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, as well as equity method investments. Our investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer (the \u201cMeasurement Alternative\u201d). Non-marketable equity securities also include our investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee and these securities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, and our share of earnings or losses from investments accounted for using the equity method are recognized in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss).\nWe assess whether an impairment loss on our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative has occurred based on qualitative factors such as the companies\u2019 financial condition and business outlook, industry performance, regulatory, economic or technological environment, and other relevant events and factors affecting the company. We assess whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our equity method investments has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions. If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities or impairment is considered other-than-temporary for our equity method investments, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss).\n65\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nOur available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position are written down to fair value through a charge to other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss) if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. For the remaining available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, if we identify that the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses, taking into consideration changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies, implied yields versus benchmark yields, and the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, among other factors, we estimate the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any portion of impairment not related to credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable is primarily related to revenue earned from customers and is reduced by an allowance for credit losses. For the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for credit losses was not significant. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses when identified.\nLoans and interest receivable, held for sale\nIn June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) and other European buy now, pay later loan receivables, consisting of eligible loans and interest receivable and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans over a\n24\n-month commitment period (together, \u201celigible consumer installment receivables\u201d). In December 2024, this agreement was amended and restated to extend the commitment period to December 2026 and to increase the maximum balance of loans that can be sold at a time. Following the sale, the global investment firm becomes the owner of the eligible consumer installment receivables sold and we no longer hold an ownership interest in these receivables.\nThese sales of eligible consumer installment receivables to the global investment firm are accounted for as a true sale based on our determination that these receivables met all the necessary criteria for such accounting including legal isolation for transferred assets, ability of the transferee to pledge or exchange the transferred assets without constraint, and the transfer of control, and thus, we no longer record these receivables on our consolidated financial statements. We also concluded that our continuing involvement in the arrangement does not invalidate this determination. We maintain the servicing rights for the entire pool of the consumer installment receivables sold and receive a market-based service fee for servicing the assets sold.\nPrior to the decision to sell, this portfolio was reported at outstanding principal balances, including unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees, net of allowances for credit losses. At the time of reclassification of eligible consumer installment receivables to loans and interest receivable, held for sale in May 2023, any previously recorded allowance for credit losses for loans and interest receivable outstanding was reversed, resulting in a decrease in transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December\u00a031, 2023.\nLoans and interest receivable, held for sale as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023 represents installment consumer receivables that we originated and intend to sell to the global investment firm. Loans and interest receivable, held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, determined on an aggregate basis, with valuation changes and any associated charge-offs recorded in restructuring and other on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Interest income on interest bearing held-for-sale loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest.\nIf PayPal no longer intends to sell loans and interest receivable, held for sale, such loans would be reclassified to loans and interest receivable, held for investment. When a loan is reclassified to held for investment, any amounts previously recorded in order to measure the loan at the lower of cost or fair value are reversed on our consolidated statements of income (loss) (recognized within restructuring and other) and the loan is recorded consistent with loans held for investment.\nLoans and interest receivable, net\nLoans and interest receivable, net represents consumer loans originated under our revolving credit products (PayPal Credit) and installment credit products and merchant receivables originated under our PayPal Working Capital (\u201cPPWC\u201d) product and PayPal Business Loan (\u201cPPBL\u201d) product.\n66\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nIn the U.S., consumer interest-bearing installment products, PPWC, and PPBL are provided under a program agreement we have with an independent chartered financial institution (\u201cpartner institution\u201d). The partner institution extends credit to consumers for interest-bearing installment products and to merchants for the PPWC and PPBL products, and we purchase the related receivables originated by the partner institution. In the U.S., we extend certain short-term, interest-free, installment loans to consumers through a U.S. subsidiary. For our international consumer credit products, we extend credit in the U.K and the rest of Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and Luxembourg banking subsidiary, respectively, and in Australia and Japan, through local subsidiaries. For our merchant finance products outside the U.S., we extend working capital advances and loans in the U.K. and rest of Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and Luxembourg banking subsidiary, respectively, and working capital loans in Australia through an Australian subsidiary.\nAs part of our arrangement with the partner institution in the U.S., we sell back a participation interest in the pool of receivables for the consumer interest-bearing installment products, PPWC, and PPBL. The partner institution has no recourse against us related to their participation interests for failure of debtors to pay when due. The participation interests held by the partner institution have the same priority to the interests held by us and are subject to the same credit, prepayment, and interest rate risk associated with this pool of receivables. All risks of loss are shared pro rata based on participation interests held among all participating stakeholders. We account for the asset transfer as a sale and derecognize the portion of the participation interests for which control has been surrendered. For this arrangement, gains or losses on the sale of the participation interests are not material as the carrying amount of the participation interest sold approximates the fair value at time of transfer.\nLoans, advances, and interest and fees receivable are reported at their outstanding balances, net of any participation interests sold and unamortized deferred origination costs. We maintain the servicing rights for the entire pool of consumer and merchant receivables outstanding and receive a market-based service fee for servicing the assets underlying the participation interest sold.\nWe offer both revolving and installment credit products to our consumers. The terms of our consumer relationships require us to submit monthly bills to the consumer detailing loan repayment requirements. The terms also allow us to charge the consumer interest and fees in certain circumstances. Due to the relatively small dollar amount of individual loans and interest receivable, we do not require collateral on these balances.\nIn certain instances where a merchant is able to demonstrate that it is experiencing financial difficulty, there may be a modification of the loan or advance and the related interest or fee receivable for which it is probable that, without modification, we would be unable to collect all amounts due.\nAnother partner institution is the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit consumer financing program in the U.S. We do not hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program and therefore, do not record these receivables on our consolidated financial statements. PayPal earns a revenue share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by the partner institution, which is recorded in revenues from other value added services on our consolidated statements of income (loss).\nAllowance for loans and interest receivable\nThe allowance for loans and interest receivable represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and interest receivables. Changes to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as a component of transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Changes to the allowance for interest and fees receivable are reflected within revenues from other value added services in net revenues on our consolidated statements of income (loss), or within deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, when interest and fees are billed at the inception of a loan or advance. The evaluation process to assess the adequacy of allowances is subject to numerous estimates and judgments.\n67\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nThe allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable not classified as held for sale is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data and incorporates macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. The consumer loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region, loan term, delinquency, credit rating, vintage, and for the revolving credit portfolio, macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales. The forecasted macroeconomic factors are sourced externally, using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. For both 2024 and 2023, the reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving products and installment products (not classified as held for sale) that we have included in our projected loss rates, which approximates the estimated life of the loans, was approximately\n5\nyears and\n7\nmonths to\n3.5\nyears, respectively. Projected loss rates (inclusive of historical loss data and for the revolving credit portfolio, macroeconomic factors) are derived based on and applied to the principal amount of our consumer receivables. We also include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses, such as expectations of macroeconomic conditions not captured in the loss models for our installment products (not classified as held for sale). The allowance for current expected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography, delinquency, and period of origination, among other factors.\nWe charge off consumer receivable balances in the month in which a customer\u2019s balance becomes\n180\ndays past the billing date or contractual repayment date, except for the U.S. consumer interest-bearing installment receivables, which are charged off\n120\ndays past the contractual repayment date. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable and subsequent recoveries, if any, are recorded as an increase to the allowance for loans and interest receivable. Loans receivable continue to accrue interest until they are charged off.\nIn connection with the sale of our eligible consumer installment receivables and the reclassification of that portfolio as held for sale in 2023, we reversed the previously recorded allowances for credit losses associated with those loans and interest receivable balances. Charge-offs and any adjustments to the fair value of loans and interest receivable, held for sale, are recorded in restructuring and other on our consolidated statement of income (loss).\nThe allowance for merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data as well as macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. In the third quarter of 2024, we updated our expected credit loss model for our PPWC portfolio to reflect its current risk characteristics. These changes did not have a material impact on our provision recorded in the year ended December\u00a031, 2024. The merchant loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region, first borrowing versus repeat borrowing, delinquency, internally developed risk ratings, and vintage, as well as macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in unemployment rates and retail e-commerce sales. The forecasted macroeconomic factors are sourced externally, using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. The reasonable and supportable forecast period for merchant products that we have included in our projected loss rates for 2024 and 2023, which approximates the estimated life of the loans, was approximately\n2.5\nto\n3.5\nyears. Projected loss rates, inclusive of historical loss data and macroeconomic factors, are derived based on and applied to the principal amount of our merchant receivables. We also include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses. The allowance for current expected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography, delinquency, and period of origination, among other factors.\nFor merchant loans and advances, the determination of delinquency is based on the current expected or contractual repayment period of the loan or advance and fixed interest or fee payment as compared to the original expected or contractual repayment period. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPBL product when the repayments are\n180\ndays past the contractual repayment date. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPWC product when the repayments are\n180\ndays past our expectation of repayments and the merchant has not made a payment in the last\n60\ndays, or when the repayments are\n360\ndays past due regardless of whether the merchant has made a payment in the last\n60\ndays. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable and subsequent recoveries, if any, are recorded as an increase to the allowance for loans and interest receivable.\n68\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nCustomer accounts\nWe hold all customer balances, both in the U.S. and internationally, as direct claims against us which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a liability classified as amounts due to customers. Certain jurisdictions where PayPal operates require us to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in these jurisdictions, equal to at least\n100\n% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. Therefore, we restrict the use of the assets underlying the customer balances to meet these regulatory requirements and separately classify the assets as customer accounts on our consolidated balance sheets. We classify the assets underlying the customer balances as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct obligation under amounts due to customers. Customer funds for which PayPal is an agent and custodian on behalf of our customers are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. These funds include U.S. dollar funds which are deposited at one or more third-party financial institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) and are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance (subject to applicable limits).\nThe Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the \u201cCSSF\u201d) has agreed that PayPal\u2019s management may designate up to\n50\n% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund European, U.K., and U.S. credit activities. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, the cumulative amount approved by PayPal to be designated to fund credit activities was $\n2.0\nbillion and $\n3.0\nbillion, respectively, and represented approximately\n26\n% and\n39\n% of European customer balances made available for our corporate use as of those respective dates, as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. At the time PayPal\u2019s management designates the European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit, the balances are classified as cash and cash equivalents and no longer classified as customer accounts on our consolidated balance sheets. The remaining assets underlying the customer balances remain separately classified as customer accounts on our consolidated balance sheets. We identify these customer accounts separately from corporate funds and maintain them in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, and available-for-sale debt securities. Customer balances deposited with our partners on a short-term basis in advance of customer transactions and used to fulfill our direct obligation under amounts due to customers are classified as cash and cash equivalents within our customer accounts classification on our consolidated balance sheets. See \u201cNote\u00a08\u2014Cash and Cash Equivalents, Funds Receivable and Customer Accounts, and Investments\u201d for additional information related to customer accounts.\nUnder applicable accounting standards, we are an agent when facilitating cryptocurrency transactions on behalf of our customers. Cryptocurrencies held on behalf of our customers are not PayPal\u2019s assets and therefore, are not reflected as cryptocurrency assets on our consolidated balance sheets; however, we recognize a crypto asset safeguarding liability with a corresponding safeguarding asset to reflect our obligation to safeguard the cryptocurrencies held on behalf of our customers.\nFunds receivable and funds payable\nFunds receivable and funds payable arise due to the time required to initiate collection from and clear transactions through external payment networks. When customers fund their PayPal account using their bank account, credit card, or debit card, or withdraw funds from their PayPal account to their bank account or through a debit card transaction, there is a clearing period before the cash is received or settled, usually\none\nto\nthree\nbusiness days for U.S. transactions and generally up to\nfive\nbusiness days for international transactions. In addition, a portion of our customers\u2019 funds are settled directly to their bank account. These funds are also classified as funds receivable and funds payable and arise due to the time required to initiate collection from and clear transactions through external payment networks.\nWe present changes in funds receivable and funds payable and amounts due to customers as cash flows from investing activities and financing activities, respectively, on our consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the activity underlying our customer accounts.\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment consists primarily of computer equipment, software and website development costs, land and buildings, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets; generally,\none\nto\nfive years\nfor computer equipment and software, including capitalized software and website development costs,\nthree years\nfor furniture and fixtures, up to\n30\nyears for buildings and building improvements, and the shorter of\nfive years\nor the non-cancelable term of the lease for leasehold improvements.\n69\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nDirect costs incurred to develop software for internal use and website development costs, including those costs incurred in expanding and enhancing our payments platform, are capitalized and amortized generally over an estimated useful life of\nthree years\nand are recorded as amortization within the financial statement captions aligned with the internal organizations that are the primary beneficiaries of such assets. We capitalized $\n509\nmillion and $\n445\nmillion of internally developed software and website development costs for the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amortization expense for these capitalized costs was $\n498\nmillion, $\n482\nmillion, and $\n426\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Costs related to the maintenance of internal use software and website development costs are expensed as incurred.\nLeases\nWe determine whether an arrangement is a lease for accounting purposes at contract inception. Operating leases are recorded as right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets which are included in\nother assets\n, and lease liabilities which are included in\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities\nand\nother long-term liabilities\non our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets for finance leases are included in property and equipment, and lease liabilities for finance leases are included in\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities\nand\nother long-term liabilities\non our consolidated balance sheets. For sale-leaseback transactions, we evaluate the sale and the lease arrangement based on our conclusion as to whether control of the underlying asset has been transferred, and recognize the sale-leaseback as either a sale transaction or under the financing method. The financing method requires the asset to remain on our consolidated balance sheets throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds to be recognized as a financing obligation.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. A majority of our leases do not provide an implicit rate and therefore we use an incremental borrowing rate for specific terms on a collateralized basis using information available on the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset calculation includes lease payments to be made and excludes lease incentives. The ROU asset and lease liability may include amounts attributed to options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain we will exercise that option. When we reach a decision to exercise a lease renewal or termination option, we recognize the associated impact to the ROU asset and lease liability. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense for finance leases is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and interest expense for finance lease liabilities is recognized based on the implicit rate or the incremental borrowing rate.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. We have elected to apply the practical expedient and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all leases, where applicable. In addition, we have elected to apply the practical expedients related to lease classification, hindsight, and land easement. We apply a single portfolio approach to account for the ROU assets and lease liabilities.\nWe evaluate ROU assets related to leases for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an ROU asset may not be recoverable. When a decision has been made to exit a lease prior to the contractual term or to sublease that space, we evaluate the asset for impairment and recognize the associated impact to the ROU asset and related expense, if applicable. The evaluation is performed at the asset group level initially and where appropriate, at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual lease level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related ROU assets are estimated over the ROU assets\u2019 useful lives. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the ROU assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related ROU asset or asset group as determined by appropriate valuation techniques.\n70\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nGoodwill and intangible assets\nGoodwill is tested for impairment, at a minimum, on an annual basis at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit\u2019s carrying value is compared to its fair value. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the reporting unit may be estimated using income and market approaches. The discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach, uses expected future operating results and a market participant discount rate. The market approach uses comparable company prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions (either publicly traded entities or mergers and acquisitions) to develop pricing metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results of the reporting unit. Failure to achieve these expected results, changes in the discount rate, or market pricing metrics may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August\u00a031, 2024 and 2023. We determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill of our reporting unit was required. As of December\u00a031, 2024, we determined that no events occurred, or circumstances changed from August\u00a031, 2024 through December\u00a031, 2024 that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired customer list and user base intangible assets, marketing related intangibles, developed technology, and other intangible assets. Intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives ranging from\nthree\nto\nseven years\n. No significant residual value is estimated for intangible assets.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted cash flow the asset is expected to generate.\nAllowance for transaction losses\nWe are exposed to transaction losses due to credit card and other payment misuse as well as nonperformance from sellers who accept payments through PayPal. We establish an allowance for estimated losses arising from completing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased items, purchase protection program claims, and account takeovers. This allowance represents an accumulation of the estimated amounts of probable transaction losses as of the reporting date. The allowance is monitored regularly and is updated based on actual loss data. The allowance is based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types, as appropriate. Additions to the allowance are reflected as a component of transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss). The allowance for transaction losses is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for negative customer balances\nNegative customer balances occur primarily when there are insufficient funds in a customer\u2019s PayPal account to cover charges applied for bank returns and reversals, debit card transactions, and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased items, which are generally within the scope of our protection programs. Negative customer balances can be cured by the customer by adding funds to their account, receiving payments, or through back-up funding sources. We also utilize third-party collection agencies. For negative customer balances that are not expected to be cured or otherwise collected, we provide an allowance for expected losses. The allowance represents expected losses based on historical trends involving collection and write-off patterns, internal factors including our experience with similar cases, other known facts and circumstances, and reasonable and supportable macroeconomic forecasts, as appropriate. Loss rates are derived using historical loss data for each delinquency bucket using a roll rate model that captures the losses and the likelihood that a negative customer balance will be written off as the delinquency age of such balance increases. The loss rates are then applied to the outstanding negative customer balances. Once the quantitative calculation is performed, we review the adequacy of the allowance and determine if qualitative adjustments need to be considered. We write-off negative customer balances in the month in which the balance becomes outstanding for\n120\ndays. Write-offs that are recovered are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for negative customer balances. Negative customer balances are included in other current assets, net of the allowance on our consolidated balance sheets. Adjustments to the allowance for negative customer balances are recorded as a component of transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss).\n71\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nDerivative instruments\nSee \u201cNote\u00a010\u2014Derivative Instruments\u201d for information related to the derivative instruments.\nRepurchase and reverse repurchase agreements\nWe enter into repurchase agreements as a form of secured borrowing and reverse repurchase agreements as a form of secured lending, primarily to provide additional liquidity and to deploy excess cash. These agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions. Repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are reported in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet and recorded at amortized cost.\nFair value measurements\nWe measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis and certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis when a change in fair value or impairment is evidenced. Fair value is defined as the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The categorization within the following three-level fair value hierarchy for our recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements is based upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\n\u2022\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\u2022\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be market-corroborated.\n\u2022\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that cannot be directly corroborated by observable market data and that typically reflect management\u2019s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nSee \u201cNote 9\u2014Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities\u201d for additional information related to our fair value measurements.\nCrypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset\nSee \u201cNote\u00a07\u2014Other Financial Statement Details\u201d for information related to our crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset.\nConcentrations of risk\nOur cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, loans and interest receivable, net, funds receivable and customer accounts, long-term investments, and other assets, are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash, cash equivalents, and customer accounts are placed with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. In addition, funds receivable are generated primarily with financial institutions which management believes are of high credit quality. We invest our cash, cash equivalents, and customer accounts primarily in highly liquid, highly rated instruments which are uninsured. We have corporate deposit balances with financial services institutions which exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000. As part of our cash management process, we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. Our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers located in the U.S. and internationally. Our loans and interest receivable are derived from consumer and merchant financing activities for customers located in the U.S. and internationally. Our long-term notes receivable and contract asset within other assets are associated with the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables to a partner institution. Transaction expense is derived from fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions, located in the U.S. and internationally, when we draw funds from a customer\u2019s credit or debit card, bank account, or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, one partner institution accounted for\n14\n% and\n15\n% of net accounts receivables, respectively. The same partner institution accounted for our long-term notes receivable and contract asset balance, which represented\n17\n% and\n16\n% of other assets at December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No customer accounted for more than 10% of net loans receivable as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, no customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues. During the year ended December\u00a031, 2024, two payment processors accounted for\n48\n% of transaction expense. During the years ended December\u00a031, 2023 and 2022, one payment processor accounted for\n60\n% and\n63\n% of transaction expense, respectively.\n72\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nRevenue recognition\nSee \u201cNote\u00a02\u2014Revenue\u201d for information related to our revenue recognition.\nAdvertising expense\nWe expense the cost of producing advertisements at the time production occurs and expense the cost of communicating advertisements in the period during which the advertising space or airtime is used as sales and marketing expense. Online advertising expenses are recognized based on the terms of the individual agreements, which are generally based on the number of impressions delivered over the total number of contracted impressions, on a pay-per-click basis, or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.\nAdvertising expense totaled $\n574\nmillion, $\n364\nmillion, and $\n518\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nDefined contribution savings plans\nWe have a defined contribution savings plan in the U.S. which qualifies under Section\u00a0401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cCode\u201d). Our non-U.S. employees are covered by other savings plans. Expenses related to our defined contribution savings plans are recorded when services are rendered by our employees.\nStock-based compensation\nWe determine compensation expense associated with restricted stock units, performance based restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards based on the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We determine compensation expense associated with stock options based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We generally recognize compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method over the respective vesting period for awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. When estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behavior of our employees as well as trends of actual forfeitures.\nForeign currency\nMany of our foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency of their respective countries as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using daily exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from these translations are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d). Gains and losses from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions into the functional currency are recognized as other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss).\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be realized based on available evidence. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We account for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income as a current-period expense when incurred.\n73\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net includes:\n\u2022\ninterest income, which consists of interest earned on corporate cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments,\n\u2022\ninterest expense, which consists of interest expense, fees, and amortization of debt discount on our long-term debt (including current portion) and credit facilities,\n\u2022\nrealized and unrealized gains (losses) on strategic investments, and\n\u2022\nother, which primarily includes foreign exchange gains and losses due to remeasurement of certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, forward points on derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, and fair value changes on the derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments.\nRecent accounting guidance\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2023-08,\nIntangibles \u2013 Goodwill and Other \u2013 Crypto Assets\n(Subtopic 350-60):\nAccounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets\n. This amended guidance requires fair value measurement of certain crypto assets each reporting period with the changes in fair value reflected in net income. The amendments also require disclosures of the name, fair value, units held, and cost bases for each significant crypto asset held and annual reconciliations of crypto asset holdings. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2025. We have applied the amendments of this guidance as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes\n(Topic 740):\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures\n. The amended guidance enhances income tax disclosures primarily related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This guidance requires disclosure of specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation and further information on reconciling items meeting a quantitative threshold. In addition, the amended guidance requires disaggregating income taxes paid (net of refunds received) by federal, state, and foreign taxes. It also requires disaggregating individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). The amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are evaluating the impact this amended guidance may have on the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,\nIncome Statement \u2013 Reporting Comprehensive Income \u2013 Expense Disaggregation Disclosures\n(Subtopic 220-40):\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\n. The amended guidance requires disaggregation of certain expense captions into specified natural expense categories in the disclosures within the notes to the financial statements. In addition, the guidance requires disclosure of selling expenses and its definition. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The guidance can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are evaluating the impact this amended guidance may have on the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2025, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122 (\u201cSAB 122\u201d) rescinding SAB 121, which required an  entity to record a liability to reflect its obligation to safeguard the crypto assets held for its platform users with a corresponding asset and required disclosures related to the entity\u2019s safeguarding obligations. SAB 122 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and is required to be applied on a fully retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption we will no longer recognize the crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset on our consolidated financial statements.\n74\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nRecently adopted accounting guidance\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,\nSegment Reporting\n(Topic 280):\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n. The amended guidance requires incremental reportable segment disclosures, primarily about significant segment expenses. The amendments also require entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2024. For additional information, see \u201cNote 18\u2014Segment Information.\u201d\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these new accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nNOTE 2\u2014\nREVENUE\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers on our payments platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into\ntwo\ncategories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services.\nTRANSACTION REVENUES\nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a fixed and variable component. The variable component is generally a percentage of the value of the payment amount and is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement when the underlying transaction is approved for a refund. We estimate the amount of fee refunds that will be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity processed on our payments platform, which results in transaction revenue, is referred to as Total Payment Volume (\u201cTPV\u201d). We generate additional revenues from merchants and consumers: on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our customers.\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already provided. Our contracts generally renew automatically without any significant material rights. Some of our contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes. We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs.\nOur primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using our risk assessment tools, we perform a transaction risk assessment on individual transactions to determine whether a transaction should be authorized for completion on our payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.\nWe recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of completing a payment transaction. As a principal to the transaction, we control the service of completing payments on our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services. Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer support.\n75\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nTo promote engagement and acquire new users on our platform, we may provide incentives to merchants and consumers in various forms including discounts on fees, rebates, rewards, and coupons. Evaluating whether an incentive is a payment to a customer requires judgment. Incentives that are determined to be consideration payable to a customer or paid on behalf of a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue. Incentives based on performance targets are recorded as a reduction to revenue when earned based on management\u2019s estimate of each customer\u2019s future performance, and incentives not based on performance targets are amortized as a reduction of revenue ratably over the contractual term. Certain incentives paid to users that are not our customers are classified as sales and marketing expense.\nWe provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform. These protection programs help protect both merchants and consumers from financial loss, resulting from, among other things, counterparty non-performance. These protection programs do not provide a separate service to our customers and we estimate and record associated costs in transaction and credit losses during the period the payment transaction is completed.\nREVENUES FROM\nOTHER VALUE ADDED SERVICES\nWe earn revenues from other value added services, which are comprised primarily of revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services that we provide to our consumers and merchants. These contracts typically have\none\nperformance obligation which is provided and recognized over the term of the contract. The transaction price is generally fixed and known at the end of each reporting period; however, for some agreements, it may be necessary to estimate the transaction price using the expected value method. Revenue earned from other value added services is recorded on a net basis when we are considered the agent with respect to processing transactions.\nWe also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances. Interest and fees earned on the portfolio of loans receivable are computed and recognized based on the effective interest method and are presented net of any required reserves and amortization of deferred origination costs.\nWe record a contract asset when we have a conditional right to consideration for services we have already transferred to our customer.\nThese contract assets are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and were $\n207\nmillion and $\n185\nmillion as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE\nWe believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services). Revenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue recognition models are substantially similar.\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by primary geographical market and category:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nPrimary geographical markets\nU.S.\n$\n18,267\n$\n17,253\n$\n15,807\nOther countries\n(1)\n13,530\n12,518\n11,711\nTotal net revenues\n(2)\n$\n31,797\n$\n29,771\n$\n27,518\nRevenue category\nTransaction revenues\n$\n28,842\n$\n26,857\n$\n25,206\nRevenues from other value added services\n2,955\n2,914\n2,312\nTotal net revenues\n(2)\n$\n31,797\n$\n29,771\n$\n27,518\n(1)\nNo single country included in the other countries category generated more than 10% of total net revenues.\n(2)\nTotal net revenues include\u00a0$\n2.1\nbillion, $\n1.8\nbillion, and $\n1.3\nbillion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, which do not represent revenues recognized in the scope of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606,\nRevenue from contracts with customers.\nSuch revenues relate to\n76\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\ninterest and fees earned on loans and interest receivable, including loans and interest receivable held for sale, as well as hedging gains or losses, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\nNet revenues are attributed to the country in which the party paying our fee is located.\nNOTE 3\u2014\nNET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding equity incentive awards is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share excludes all anti-dilutive common shares. During periods when we report net loss, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share because the effects of potentially dilutive items would decrease the net loss per share.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss)\n$\n4,147\n$\n4,246\n$\n2,419\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares of common stock\n\u2014\nbasic\n1,029\n1,103\n1,154\nDilutive effect of equity incentive awards\n10\n4\n4\nWeighted average shares of common stock\n\u2014\ndiluted\n1,039\n1,107\n1,158\nNet income (loss) per share:\nBasic\n$\n4.03\n$\n3.85\n$\n2.10\nDiluted\n$\n3.99\n$\n3.84\n$\n2.09\nCommon stock equivalents excluded from net income (loss) per diluted share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive or potentially dilutive\n9\n21\n13\nNOTE\u00a04\u2014\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nThere were\nno\nacquisitions accounted for as business combinations completed in 2024, 2023, or 2022.

In the event of changes to the relevant index, lease liabilities are not remeasured and instead are treated as variable lease payments and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nThe short-term lease exemption has been adopted for all leases with a duration of less than 12 months.\nPayPal\u2019s lease portfolio includes a small number of subleases.

These cryptocurrencies consist of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and PayPal USD stablecoin (collectively,\n\u201cour customers\u2019 crypto assets\u201d).

We also recognize a corresponding safeguarding asset which is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

The corresponding safeguarding asset may be adjusted for loss events, as applicable.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, the Company had not incurred any safeguarding loss events, and therefore,

Our marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values and are recorded as long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Marketable equity securities totaled $\n23\nmillion and $\n24\nmillion as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur non-marketable equity securities are recorded in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities totaled $\n1.5\nbillion and $\n1.8\nbillion as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, we had non-marketable equity securities of $\n200\nmillion and $\n182\nmillion, respectively, for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. We account for these equity securities using the equity method of accounting. The remaining non-marketable equity securities do not have a readily determinable fair value and we measure these equity investments at cost minus impairment, if any, and adjust for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, and our share of earnings or losses from investments accounted for using the equity method are recognized in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss).\nMeasurement Alternative adjustments\nThe adjustments to the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative in the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nCarrying amount, beginning of period\n$\n1,631\n$\n1,687\nAdjustments related to non-marketable equity securities:\nNet (sales) additions\n(1)\n(\n2\n)\n67\nGross unrealized gains\n20\n32\nGross unrealized losses and impairments\n(\n313\n)\n(\n155\n)\nCarrying amount, end of period\n$\n1,336\n$\n1,631\n(1)\nNet (sales) additions include purchases, reductions due to sales of securities, and reclassifications when the Measurement Alternative is subsequently elected or no longer applies.\nThe following table summarizes the cumulative gross unrealized gains and cumulative gross unrealized losses and impairment related to non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative, held at December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\n(In millions)\nCumulative gross unrealized gains\n$\n1,187\n$\n1,168\nCumulative gross unrealized losses and impairments\n$\n(\n562\n)\n$\n(\n283\n)\n89\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nUnrealized gains (losses) on strategic investments, excluding those accounted for using the equity method\nThe following table summarizes the net unrealized gains (losses) on marketable and non-marketable equity securities, excluding those accounted for using the equity method, held at December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nNet unrealized gains (losses)\n$\n(\n270\n)\n$\n(\n128\n)\n90\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nNOTE\u00a09\u2014\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS\nThe following tables summarize our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023:\nDecember 31, 2024\nQuoted\u00a0Prices\u00a0in\nActive\u00a0Markets\u00a0for\nIdentical Assets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\u00a0Other Observable\u00a0Inputs (Level 2)\n(In millions)\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n(1)\n:\nMoney market fund\n$\n14\n$\n14\n$\n\u2014\nShort-term investments\n(2)\n:\nU.S. government and agency securities\n186\n\u2014\n186\nForeign government and agency securities\n84\n\u2014\n84\nCorporate debt securities\n1,749\n\u2014\n1,749\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed securities\n853\n\u2014\n853\nCommercial paper\n1,282\n\u2014\n1,282\nTotal short-term investments\n4,154\n\u2014\n4,154\nFunds receivable and customer accounts\n(3)\n:\nU.S. government and agency securities\n5,711\n\u2014\n5,711\nForeign government and agency securities\n379\n\u2014\n379\nCorporate debt securities\n667\n\u2014\n667\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed securities\n4,047\n\u2014\n4,047\nMunicipal securities\n504\n\u2014\n504\nCommercial paper\n3,392\n\u2014\n3,392\nTotal funds receivable and customer accounts\n14,700\n\u2014\n14,700\nDerivatives\n(4)\n243\n\u2014\n243\nCrypto asset safeguarding asset\n(4)\n2,886\n\u2014\n2,886\nLong-term investments\n(2),(5)\n:\nU.S. government and agency securities\n235\n\u2014\n235\nForeign government and agency securities\n123\n\u2014\n123\nCorporate debt securities\n1,602\n\u2014\n1,602\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed securities\n1,042\n\u2014\n1,042\nMarketable equity securities\n23\n23\n\u2014\nTotal long-term investments\n3,025\n23\n3,002\nTotal financial assets\n$\n25,022\n$\n37\n$\n24,985\nLiabilities:\nDerivatives\n(4)\n$\n37\n$\n\u2014\n$\n37\nCrypto asset safeguarding liability\n(4)\n2,886\n\u2014\n2,886\nTotal financial liabilities\n$\n2,923\n$\n\u2014\n$\n2,923\n(1)\nExcludes cash of $\n6.5\nbillion not measured and recorded at fair value.\n(2)\nExcludes restricted cash of $\n1\nmillion and time deposits of $\n129\nmillion not measured and recorded at fair value.\n(3)\nExcludes cash, time deposits, and funds receivable of $\n23.0\nbillion underlying funds receivable and customer accounts not measured and recorded at fair value.\n(4)\nDerivative assets and liabilities are included within \u201cprepaid expenses and other current assets\u201d and \u201cother assets\u201d and \u201caccrued expenses and other current liabilities\u201d and \u201cother long-term liabilities,\u201d respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.

Accordingly, we have valued the asset and liability using quoted prices on the active exchange that we have identified as the principal market for the underlying crypto assets (Level 2). All other financial assets and liabilities are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in less active markets, readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, or models using market observable inputs (Level 2).\nA majority of our derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that take into account the contract terms as well as multiple observable inputs where applicable, such as currency rates, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, and equity prices (Level 2).\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any assets or liabilities requiring measurement at fair value on a recurring basis with significant unobservable inputs that would require a high level of judgment to determine fair value (Level\u00a03).\nWe elect to account for available-for-sale debt securities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows us to recognize any gains and losses from fair value changes on such investments in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income (loss) to significantly reduce the accounting asymmetry that would otherwise arise when recognizing the corresponding foreign exchange gains and losses relating to customer liabilities.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value and amortized cost of our available-for-sale debt securities under the fair value option as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAmortized Cost\nFair Value\nAmortized Cost\nFair Value\n(In millions)\nFunds receivable and customer accounts\n$\n566\n$\n564\n$\n625\n$\n618\nThe following table summarizes the gains (losses) from fair value changes recognized in other income (expense), net related to the available-for-sale debt securities under the fair value option for the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023\n:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nFunds receivable and customer accounts\n$\n(\n29\n)\n$\n13\nASSETS MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS\nThe following tables summarize our assets held as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023 for which a non-recurring fair value measurement was recorded during the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nDecember 31, 2024\nSignificant\u00a0Other Observable\u00a0Inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant\u00a0Other Unobservable\u00a0Inputs (Level 3)\n(In millions)\nLoans and interest receivable, held for sale\n$\n541\n$\n541\n$\n\u2014\nNon-marketable equity securities measured using the Measurement Alternative\n(1)\n476\n131\n345\nTotal\n$\n1,017\n$\n672\n$\n345\n(1)\nExcludes non-marketable equity securities of $\n860\nmillion accounted for under the Measurement Alternative for which no observable price changes occurred during the year ended December\u00a031, 2024.\n93\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nDecember 31, 2023\nSignificant\u00a0Other Observable\u00a0Inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant\u00a0Other Unobservable\u00a0Inputs (Level 3)\n(In millions)\nLoans and interest receivable, held for sale\n(1)\n$\n563\n$\n\u2014\n$\n563\nNon-marketable equity securities measured using the Measurement Alternative\n(2)\n440\n131\n309\nOther assets\n(3)\n112\n112\n\u2014\nTotal\n$\n1,115\n$\n243\n$\n872\n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2023, loans and interest receivable, held for sale were valued using a price-based model.

Accordingly, loans and interest receivable, held for sale are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to \u201cNote 11\u2014Loans and Interest Receivable\u201d for additional information on loans and interest receivable, held for sale.\nWe measure the non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative at cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable price changes are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value based on valuation methods which only include significant inputs that are observable, such as the observable transaction price at the transaction date. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 when we estimate fair value using significant unobservable inputs such as when we remeasure due to impairment and use discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others.\nWe evaluate ROU assets related to leases for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an ROU asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses on ROU lease assets related to office operating leases are calculated using estimated rental income per square foot derived from observable market data, and the impaired asset is classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE\nOur financial instruments, including cash, restricted cash, time deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, loans and interest receivable, net, certain customer accounts, notes receivable, and long-term debt related to borrowings on our credit facilities are carried at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value. Our term debt (including current portion) in the form of fixed rate notes had a carrying value of approximately $\n10.5\nbillion and fair value of approximately $\n9.8\nbillion as of December\u00a031, 2024. Our term debt (including current portion) in the form of fixed rate notes had a carrying value of approximately $\n10.6\nbillion and fair value of approximately $\n10.0\nbillion as of December\u00a031, 2023. If these financial instruments were measured at fair value in the financial statements, cash would be classified as Level 1; restricted cash, time deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, certain customer accounts, and term debt (including current portion) would be classified as Level 2; and the remaining financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nNOTE\u00a010\u2014\nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nSUMMARY OF\nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nOur primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that our counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions and by entering into collateral security arrangements. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. We do not use any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n94\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nCash flow hedges\nWe have significant international revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, which subjects us to foreign exchange risk. We have a foreign currency exposure management program in which we designate certain foreign exchange contracts, generally with maturities of\n12\nmonths or less, to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of these foreign exchange contracts is to help mitigate the risk that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are adversely affected by changes in the applicable U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the derivative\u2019s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into revenue or applicable expense line item in the consolidated statements of income (loss) in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. We evaluate the effectiveness of our foreign exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by comparing the critical terms of the derivative instruments with the critical terms of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item; if the critical terms are the same, we conclude the hedge will be perfectly effective. We do not exclude any component of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We report cash flows arising from derivative instruments consistent with the classification of cash flows from the underlying hedged items that these derivatives are hedging. Accordingly, the cash flows associated with derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are classified in cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024, we estimated that $\n147\nmillion of net derivative gains related to our cash flow hedges included in AOCI are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur and as such, did not reclassify any gains or losses to earnings prior to the occurrence of the hedged transaction.\u00a0If we elect to discontinue our cash flow hedges and it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur, we continue to report the derivative\u2019s gain or loss in AOCI until the forecasted transaction affects earnings, at which point we also reclassify it into earnings. Gains and losses on derivatives held after we discontinue our cash flow hedges and on derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in the same financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.\nNet investment hedges\nWe use forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. These derivatives are designated as net investment hedges and accordingly, the gains and losses on the portion of the derivatives included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recorded in AOCI as part of foreign currency translation. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize them in other income (expense), net on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. The accumulated gains and losses associated with these instruments will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point they will be reclassified into earnings. The cash flows associated with derivatives designated as a net investment hedge are classified in cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nWe have\nno\nt reclassified any gains or losses related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings for any of the periods presented.\nForeign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments\nWe have a foreign currency exposure management program in which we use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk of our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The gains and losses due to remeasurement of certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset by the gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts. The cash flows associated with our non-designated derivatives used to hedge foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are classified in cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n95\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nFAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS\nThe fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:\nBalance Sheet Location\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nDerivative Assets:\n(In millions)\nForeign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments\nOther current assets\n$\n157\n$\n7\nForeign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments\nOther assets (non-current)\n\u2014\n77\nForeign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments\nOther current assets\n86\n57\nTotal derivative assets\n$\n243\n$\n141\nDerivative Liabilities:\nForeign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments\nOther current liabilities\n$\n10\n$\n64\nForeign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments\nOther current liabilities\n27\n67\nTotal derivative liabilities\n$\n37\n$\n131\nEFFECT OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table provides the location in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and amount of recognized gains or losses related to our derivative instruments:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nNet revenues\nOther income (expense), net\nNet revenues\nOther income (expense), net\nNet revenues\nOther income (expense), net\nTotal amounts presented in the consolidated statements of income (loss) in which the effects of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded\n$\n31,797\n$\n4\n$\n29,771\n$\n383\n$\n27,518\n$\n(\n471\n)\nGains (losses) on derivatives in cash flow hedging relationship:\nAmount of net gains (losses) on foreign exchange contracts reclassified from AOCI\n48\n\u2014\n111\n\u2014\n462\n\u2014\nGains (losses) on derivatives in net investment hedging relationship:\nAmount of net gains (losses) on foreign exchange contracts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness\n\u2014\n67\n\u2014\n100\n\u2014\n84\nGains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nAmount of net gains (losses) on foreign exchange contracts\n\u2014\n111\n\u2014\n(\n263\n)\n\u2014\n118\nAmount of gains (losses) on equity derivative contracts\n(1)\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n44\n\u2014\n(\n174\n)\nTotal net gains (losses)\n$\n48\n$\n178\n$\n111\n$\n(\n119\n)\n$\n462\n$\n28\n(1)\nDuring the years ended December\u00a031, 2023 and 2022, equity derivative contracts were entered into and matured in association with the sale of marketable equity securities related to strategic investments.

Additionally, we offer installment credit products at the time of checkout in various markets, including the U.S., several markets across Europe, Australia, and Japan. We offer non interest-bearing installment credit products in these markets as well as interest-bearing installment credit products in the U.S. and Germany. We purchase receivables related to interest-bearing installment loans extended to U.S. consumers by a partner institution and are responsible for the servicing functions related to that portfolio. During the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, we purchased approximately $\n690\nmillion and $\n670\nmillion in consumer receivables, respectively.

The decrease in allowance for credit losses was related to the improvement in credit quality of interest-bearing installment loans in the U.S. offset by the growth of interest-bearing installment loans in the U.S., revolving loans in the U.K., and installment loans in Japan.\nMerchant receivables\nWe offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses through our PPWC and PPBL products, which we collectively refer to as our merchant finance offerings. We purchase receivables related to credit extended to U.S. merchants by a partner institution and are responsible for the servicing functions related to that portfolio. During the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, we purchased approximately $\n1.8\nbillion and $\n1.7\nbillion in merchant receivables, respectively. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, the total outstanding balance in our pool of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable was $\n1.5\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion, respectively, net of the participation interest sold to the partner institution of $\n53\nmillion and $\n44\nmillion, respectively. See \u201cNote\u00a01\u2014Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for additional information on this participation arrangement.\nThrough our PPWC product, merchants can borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal and are charged a fixed fee for the loan or advance based on the overall credit assessment of the merchant. Loans and advances are repaid through a fixed percentage of the merchant\u2019s future payment volume that PayPal processes. Through our PPBL product, we provide merchants access to short-term business financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of the applying business as well as the business owner. PPBL repayments are collected through periodic payments until the balance has been satisfied.\nThe interest or fee is fixed at the time the loan or advance is extended and is recognized as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The fixed interest or fee is amortized into revenues from other value added services based on the amount repaid over the repayment period. We estimate the repayment period for PPWC based on the merchant\u2019s payment processing history with PayPal. For PPWC, there is a general requirement that at least\n10\n% of the original amount of the loan or advance plus the fixed fee must be repaid every\n90\ndays. We calculate the repayment rate of the merchant\u2019s future payment volume so that repayment of the loan or advance and fixed fee is expected to generally occur within\n9\nto\n12\nmonths from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual merchant payment processing volumes. For PPBL, we receive fixed periodic payments over the contractual term of the loan, which generally ranges from\n3\nto\n12\nmonths.\n101\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nWe actively monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected or contractual repayment period, as well as the credit quality of our merchant loans and advances that we extend or purchase, so that we can evaluate, quantify, and manage our credit risk exposure. To assess a merchant seeking a loan or advance, we use, among other indicators, risk models developed internally which utilize information obtained from multiple internal and external data sources to predict the likelihood of timely and satisfactory repayment by the merchant of the loan or advance amount and the related interest or fee. Primary drivers of the models include the merchant\u2019s annual payment volume, payment processing history with PayPal, prior repayment history with PayPal\u2019s credit products where available, information sourced from consumer and business credit bureau reports, and other information obtained during the application process. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making (or, in the U.S., to assist the partner institution in making) ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our internal models, to plan our collection strategies, and in determining our allowance for these loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable.\nMerchant receivables delinquency and allowance\nThe following tables present the delinquency status and gross charge-offs of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable by year of origination.

Interest on these notes is payable on April 1 and October 1.\nThe notes issued from the May 2024, June 2023, May 2022, May 2020, and September 2019 debt issuances are senior unsecured obligations and are collectively referred to as the \u201cNotes.\u201d Interest on the Notes is payable in arrears semiannually. We may redeem the Notes in whole, at any time, or in part (except for the June 2023 notes), from time to time, prior to maturity, at their redemption prices. Upon the occurrence of both a change of control of the Company and a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating, we will be required to offer to repurchase each series of Notes at a price equal to\n101\n% of the then outstanding principal amounts, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Notes are subject to covenants, including limitations on our ability to create liens on our assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and merge or consolidate with another entity, in each case subject to certain exceptions, limitations, and qualifications. Proceeds from the issuance of these Notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding the repayment or redemption of outstanding debt, share repurchases, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, and possible acquisitions of businesses, assets, or strategic investments.\n103\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nAs of both December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, we had an outstanding aggregate principal amount of $\n10.6\nbillion related to the Notes.\nThe following table summarizes the Notes outstanding:\nAs of December 31,\nMaturities\nEffective Interest Rate\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nSeptember 2019 debt issuance:\nFixed-rate\n2.400\n% notes\n10/1/2024\n2.52\n%\n$\n\u2014\n$\n1,250\nFixed-rate\n2.650\n% notes\n10/1/2026\n2.78\n%\n1,250\n1,250\nFixed-rate\n2.850\n% notes\n10/1/2029\n2.96\n%\n1,500\n1,500\nMay 2020 debt issuance:\nFixed-rate\n1.650\n% notes\n6/1/2025\n1.78\n%\n1,000\n1,000\nFixed-rate\n2.300\n% notes\n6/1/2030\n2.39\n%\n1,000\n1,000\nFixed-rate\n3.250\n% notes\n6/1/2050\n3.33\n%\n1,000\n1,000\nMay 2022 debt issuance:\nFixed-rate\n3.900\n% notes\n6/1/2027\n4.06\n%\n500\n500\nFixed-rate\n4.400\n% notes\n6/1/2032\n4.53\n%\n1,000\n1,000\nFixed-rate\n5.050\n% notes\n6/1/2052\n5.14\n%\n1,000\n1,000\nFixed-rate\n5.250\n% notes\n6/1/2062\n5.34\n%\n500\n500\nJune 2023 debt issuance\n(1)\n:\n\u00a5\n30\nbillion fixed-rate\n0.813\n% notes\n6/9/2025\n0.89\n%\n191\n213\n\u00a5\n23\nbillion fixed-rate\n0.972\n% notes\n6/9/2026\n1.06\n%\n147\n163\n\u00a5\n37\nbillion fixed-rate\n1.240\n% notes\n6/9/2028\n1.31\n%\n236\n262\nMay 2024 debt issuance:\nFixed-rate\n5.150\n% notes\n6/1/2034\n5.35\n%\n850\n\u2014\nFixed-rate\n5.500\n% notes\n6/1/2054\n5.66\n%\n400\n\u2014\nTotal term debt\n$\n10,574\n$\n10,638\nUnamortized premium (discount) and issuance costs, net\n(\n78\n)\n(\n68\n)\nLess: current portion of term debt\n(2)\n(\n1,191\n)\n(\n1,249\n)\nTotal carrying amount of term debt\n$\n9,305\n$\n9,321\n(1)\nPrincipal amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(2)\nThe current portion of term debt is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe effective interest rates for the Notes include interest on the Notes, amortization of debt issuance costs, and amortization of the debt discount.

The Credit Agreement includes a $\n150\nmillion letter of credit sub-facility and a $\n600\nmillion swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. Loans borrowed under the Credit Agreement are available in U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, and Australian dollar, and in each case subject to the sub-limits and other limitations provided in the Credit Agreement. We may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders and satisfaction of specified conditions, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $\n2.0\nbillion. Subject to specific conditions, we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the Credit Agreement, provided PayPal Holdings, Inc. guarantees the portion of borrowings made available and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement. As of December\u00a031, 2024, certain subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers. Funds borrowed under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other purposes not in contravention of the Credit Agreement.\nWe are obligated to pay interest on loans under the Credit Agreement and other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating. Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) the applicable term benchmark rate plus a margin (based on the Company\u2019s public debt ratings) ranging from\n0.750\n% to\n1.250\n%, (ii) the applicable Risk-Free Rate (Sterling Overnight Index Average for loans denominated in pounds sterling and Euro Short-Term Rate for loans denominated in euros) rate plus a margin (based on the Company\u2019s public debt ratings) ranging from\n0.750\n% to\n1.250\n%, (iii) the applicable overnight rate plus a margin (based on the Company\u2019s public debt ratings) ranging from\n0.750\n% to\n1.250\n% or (iv) a formula based on the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate or the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a margin (based on the Company\u2019s public debt ratings) ranging from\nzero\nto\n0.250\n%. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, the Company and any subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on June 7, 2028, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at the request of the Company or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events), or (b) the maturity date is extended upon the request of the Company, subject to the agreement of the lenders. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default, and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and the incurrence of subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant requires the Company to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023,\nno\nborrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December\u00a031, 2024, $\n5.0\nbillion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.\nPaidy credit agreement\nIn February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cPaidy Credit Agreement\u201d) with Paidy as co-borrower, which provided for an unsecured revolving credit facility of \u00a5\n60.0\nbillion, which was modified in September 2022, to increase the borrowing capacity by \u00a5\n30.0\nbillion for a total borrowing capacity of \u00a5\n90.0\nbillion (approximately $\n574\nmillion as of December\u00a031, 2024). Borrowings under the Paidy Credit Agreement are for use by Paidy for working capital, capital expenditures, and other permitted purposes. Loans under the Paidy Credit Agreement bear interest at the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin (based on our public debt rating) ranging from\n0.40\n% to\n0.60\n%. The Paidy Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owed thereunder will be due and payable in February 2027, unless the commitments are terminated earlier. The Paidy Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default, and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant requires us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.\n105\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, \u00a5\n90.0\nbillion (approximately $\n574\nmillion) and \u00a5\n50.0\nbillion (approximately $\n355\nmillion) was drawn down under the Paidy Credit Agreement, respectively, which was recorded in long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. At December\u00a031, 2024,\nno\nborrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Paidy Credit Agreement. During the years ended December\u00a031, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the total interest expense and fees we recorded related to the Paidy Credit Agreement were de minimis.\nOther available facilities\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, we had short-term borrowings of\nnil\nand $\n359\nmillion, respectively, due to bank overdrafts, which were recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowing was\n7.92\n% as of December\u00a031, 2023. We repaid $\n400\nmillion of borrowings due to bank overdrafts during the year ended December 31, 2024. The total interest expense and fees we recorded related to the borrowings were de minimis.\nWe also maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world, which had a borrowing capacity of approximately $\n80\nmillion in the aggregate, as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023. This available credit includes facilities where we can withdraw and utilize the funds at our discretion for general corporate purposes. Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings. As of December\u00a031, 2024, substantially all of the borrowing capacity under these credit facilities was available, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.\nFUTURE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024, the future principal payments associated with our term debt were as follows (in millions):\n2025\n$\n1,191\n2026\n1,397\n2027\n500\n2028\n236\n2029\n1,500\nThereafter\n5,750\nTotal\n$\n10,574\nNOTE\u00a013\u2014\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS\nOverview\nWe are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Certain of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an indeterminate amount of damages or penalties or may require us to change or adopt certain business practices. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the estimated liability in our financial statements at that time. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are not material. If we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of a legal proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies sought by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business. With respect to the matters disclosed in this Note 13, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of such non-monetary remedies.\n106\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nAmounts accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable and reasonably estimable were not material for the year ended December\u00a031, 2024. Except as otherwise noted for the proceedings described in this Note 13, we have concluded, based on currently available information, that reasonably possible losses arising directly from the proceedings (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. We may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. If any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRegulatory proceedings\nPayPal Australia Pty Limited (\u201cPPAU\u201d) self-reported a potential violation to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (\u201cAUSTRAC\u201d) on May 22, 2019. This self-reported matter relates to PPAU incorrectly filing required international funds transfer instructions over a period of time under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (\u201cAML/CTF Act\u201d). On September 23, 2019, PPAU received a notice from AUSTRAC requiring that PPAU appoint an external auditor (a partner of a firm which is not our independent auditor) to review certain aspects of PPAU\u2019s compliance with its obligations under the AML/CTF Act.\u00a0The external auditor was appointed on November 1, 2019.\nAUSTRAC had notified PPAU that its enforcement team was investigating the matters reported upon by the external auditor in its August 31, 2020 final report. As a resolution of this investigation, on March 17, 2023, AUSTRAC\u2019s Chief Executive Officer accepted an enforceable undertaking from PPAU in relation to the self-reported issues.\nThe enforceable undertaking does not include a monetary penalty. The entry into and compliance with the enforceable undertaking will not require a change to our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nPPAU is required to deliver an Assurance Action Plan (\u201cAAP\u201d) under the enforceable undertaking to demonstrate that the governance and oversight arrangements following the remedial work completed by PPAU are sustainable and appropriate. The enforceable undertaking requires PPAU to appoint an external auditor. The external auditor was appointed on June 22, 2023 to assess and report on the appropriateness, sustainability and efficacy of the actions to be taken under the AAP. PPAU provided the external auditor\u2019s final report to AUSTRAC on April 16, 2024. The successful completion of the enforceable undertaking is subject to AUSTRAC\u2019s ultimate review and decision based on the external auditor\u2019s final report. We cannot predict the outcome of AUSTRAC\u2019s decision. Any failure to comply with the enforceable undertaking could result in penalties or require us to change our business practices.\nIn February 2022, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (\u201cCID\u201d) from the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) related to PayPal\u2019s practices relating to commercial customers that submit charges on behalf of other merchants or sellers, and related activities. The CID requests the production of documents and answers to written questions. We are cooperating with the FTC in connection with this CID.\nIn January 2023, we received notice of an administrative proceeding and a related request for information from the German Federal Cartel Office (\u201cFCO\u201d) related to terms in PayPal (Europe) S.\u00e0.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A.\u2019s contractual terms with merchants in Germany prohibiting surcharging and requiring parity presentation of PayPal relative to other payment methods. We are cooperating with the FCO in connection with this proceeding.\nWe have received CIDs from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) related to investigation and error-resolution obligations under Regulation E, the presentment of transactions to linked bank accounts, and related matters. The CIDs request the production of documents and answers to written questions. We are cooperating with the CFPB in connection with these CIDs.\nIn November 2023, we received a subpoena from the U.S. SEC Division of Enforcement relating to PayPal USD stablecoin. The subpoena requests the production of documents. We are cooperating with the SEC in connection with this request.\n107\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nIn August 2024, we received a CID from the CFPB related to PayPal Credit. The CID also relates to backup payment options in a digital wallet to pay for goods or services. The CID requests the production of documents and answers to written questions. We are cooperating with the CFPB in connection with this CID.\nLegal proceedings\nOn October 4, 2022, a putative securities class action captioned\nDefined Benefit Plan of the Mid-Jersey Trucking Industry and Teamsters Local 701 Pension and Annuity Fund v. PayPal Holdings, Inc., et al.\n, Case No. 22-cv-5864, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. On January 11, 2023, the Court appointed Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec as lead plaintiff and renamed the action\nIn re PayPal Holdings, Inc. Securities Litigation\n(\u201cPPH Securities Action\u201d). On March 13, 2023, the lead plaintiff filed an amended and consolidated complaint. The PPH Securities Action asserts claims relating to our public statements with respect to net new active accounts (\u201cNNA\u201d) results and guidance, and the detection of illegitimately created accounts. The PPH Securities Action purports to be brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company\u2019s stock between February 3, 2021 and February 1, 2022 (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), and asserts claims for alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act against the Company, as well as its former Chief Executive Officer, former Chief Strategy, Growth and Data Officer, and former Chief Financial Officer (collectively, the \u201cIndividual Defendants,\u201d and together with the Company, \u201cDefendants\u201d), and for alleged violations of Sections 20(a) and 20A of the Exchange Act against the Individual Defendants. The complaint alleges that certain public statements made by Defendants during the Class Period were rendered materially false and misleading (which, allegedly, caused the Company\u2019s stock to trade at artificially inflated prices) by the Defendants\u2019 failure to disclose that, among other things, the Company\u2019s incentive campaigns were susceptible to fraud and led to the creation of illegitimate accounts, which allegedly affected the Company\u2019s NNA results and guidance. The PPH Securities Action seeks unspecified compensatory damages on behalf of the putative class members. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the PPH Securities Action. On January 29, 2025, the Court dismissed all of the claims without prejudice. The lead plaintiff has until March 17, 2025 to file an amended complaint.\nOn November 2, 2022, a putative shareholder derivative action captioned\nShah v. Daniel Schulman, et al.\n, Case No. 22-cv-1445, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the \u201cShah Action\u201d), purportedly on behalf of the Company. On April 4, 2023, a putative shareholder derivative action captioned\nNelson v. Daniel Schulman, et. al.\n, Case No. 23-cv-01913, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the \u201cNelson Action\u201d) purportedly on behalf of the Company. On January 31, 2025, a putative shareholder derivative action captioned\nSpathias v. Daniel Schulman, et al.\n, Case No. 25-cv-1007, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cSpathias Action,\u201d and collectively, the \u201cDerivative Actions\u201d). The Derivative Actions are based on the same alleged facts and circumstances as the PPH Securities Action, and name certain of our officers, including our former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer, and members of our Board of Directors, as defendants. The Derivative Actions allege claims for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, gross mismanagement and violations of the Exchange Act, and seek to recover damages on behalf of the Company. The Shah and Nelson Actions have been stayed pending further developments in the PPH Securities Action.\nOn December 20, 2022, a civil lawsuit captioned\nState of Hawai\u2018i, by its Office of Consumer Protection, v. PayPal, Inc., and PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n, Case No. 1CCV-22-0001610, was filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit of the State of Hawai\u2018i (the \u201cHawai\u2018i Action\u201d). The Hawai\u2018i Action asserts claims for unfair and deceptive acts and practices under Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes Sections 480-2(a) and 481A-3(a). Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief as well as unspecified penalties and other monetary relief. On July 14, 2023, the court denied Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint. Trial is scheduled to begin in October 2025.\n108\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nGeneral matters\nOther third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We are subject to patent disputes and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our business as our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity. Such claims may be brought directly or indirectly against our companies and/or against our customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposure to such claims as a result of our acquisitions, particularly in cases where we are introducing new products or services in connection with such acquisitions. We have in the past been forced to litigate such claims, and we believe that additional lawsuits alleging such claims will be filed against us. Intellectual property claims, whether meritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business, or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms or make substantial payments to settle claims or to satisfy damages awarded by courts.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by our consumers (individually or as class actions), merchants or regulators alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules, or policies, that our practices, prices, rules, policies, or user, product, business or merchant agreements violate applicable law, or that we have acted unfairly or not acted in conformity with such prices, rules, policies, or agreements. In addition to these types of disputes and regulatory inquiries, our operations are also subject to regulatory and legal review and challenges that may reflect the increasing global regulatory focus to which the payments industry is subject and, when taken together with other regulatory and legislative action, such actions could result in the imposition of costly new compliance burdens on our business and customers and may lead to increased costs and decreased transaction volume and revenue. Further, the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as our business has grown and expanded in scale and scope, including the number of active accounts and payments transactions on our platform, the range and increasing complexity of the products and services that we offer, and our geographical operations. Any claims or regulatory actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, settlement payments, damage awards (including statutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions), fines, penalties, injunctive relief, or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to change our products, services or business practices in expensive ways, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm our business.\nINDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS\nOur agreements with eBay governing our separation from eBay provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations for both eBay and us. Disputes between eBay and us have arisen and others may arise in the future, and an adverse outcome in such matters could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against eBay under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us, and our indemnity obligations to eBay may be significant.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have commercial relationships. Under these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by any third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos, and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are related to the subject agreement. These indemnification provisions generally include indemnity for other types of third-party claims, which may be related to intellectual property rights, confidentiality, willful misconduct, data privacy obligations, and certain breach of contract claims, among others. These indemnification provisions generally also include indemnity to our payments processors in the event of card association fines against the processor arising out of conduct by us or our customers. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation.\nPayPal has participated in the U.S. Government\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Loans made under this program were funded by an independent chartered financial institution that we partnered with. We received a fee for providing services in connection with these loans and retained operational and audit risk related to those activities. We have agreed, under certain circumstances, to indemnify the chartered financial institution and its assignee of a portion of these loans in connection with the services provided for loans made under this program.\n109\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nAs part of the agreement to sell a portion of our consumer installment receivables portfolio, in certain circumstances such as breaches in loan warranties, we may be required to indemnify the global investment firm that purchased the loans or repurchase the loans. The estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments we may be required to make is equal to the current outstanding balances of the loans sold; however, the maximum potential amount of the indemnification is not, in our view, representative of the expected future exposure. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, the current outstanding balances of the loans sold was $\n2.9\nbillion and $\n2.2\nbillion, respectively. The terms of the indemnification align to the maturities of the loans sold.\nTo date, no significant costs have been incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with our indemnification provisions.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nPROTECTION PROGRAMS\nIn addition to the protections afforded by applicable law, we provide consumers and merchants with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform. Our protection programs help protect both consumers and merchants from financial loss resulting from, among other things, counterparty non-performance. These programs are designed to promote confidence on the part of both consumers, who will be reimbursed in certain circumstances, such as not receiving their purchased item in the condition significantly as described, as well as merchants, who will receive payment in certain circumstances, such as establishing proof of shipment or delivery of an item to the customer. These protection programs are considered assurance-type warranties under applicable accounting standards for which we estimate and record associated costs in transaction and credit losses during the period the payment transaction is completed.\nAt December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for transaction losses was $\n86\nmillion and $\n64\nmillion, respectively. The allowance for negative customer balances was $\n256\nmillion and $\n218\nmillion at December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following table shows changes in the allowance for transaction losses and negative customer balances related to our\nprotection programs for the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023:\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nBeginning balance\n$\n282\n$\n278\nProvision\n1,114\n1,192\nRealized losses\n(\n1,218\n)\n(\n1,313\n)\nRecoveries\n164\n125\nEnding balance\n$\n342\n$\n282\n110\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nNOTE\u00a014\u2014\nSTOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS\nIn July 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up to\u00a0$\n10.0\nbillion\u00a0of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. In June 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $\n15.0\nbillion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. This program became effective in the first quarter of 2023 upon completion of the July 2018 stock repurchase program. In February 2025, our Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $\n15.0\nbillion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. Our stock repurchase programs are intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count.\u00a0Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase agreements, or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Moreover, any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made. We may terminate our stock repurchase programs at any time without prior notice.\nDuring the year ended December\u00a031, 2024, we repurchased approximately\n92\nmillion shares of our common stock for approximately $\n6.0\nbillion at an average cost of $\n65.55\n, excluding excise tax. These shares were purchased in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in June 2022. As of\u00a0December\u00a031, 2024, a total of approximately $\n4.9\nbillion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our June 2022 stock repurchase program.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a nondeductible 1% excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we have reflected the applicable excise tax in treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, we recorded $\n50\nmillion and $\n44\nmillion in excise tax within treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets, respectively. The payable associated with the excise tax is a non-cash financing activity which is not reflected on the consolidated statement of cash flows until settled.\nDuring the year ended December\u00a031, 2023, we repurchased approximately\n74\nmillion shares of our common stock for approximately $\n5.0\nbillion at an average cost of $\n67.72\n, excluding excise tax. These shares were purchased in the open market under our stock repurchase programs authorized in July 2018 and June 2022. As of December\u00a031, 2023, a total of approximately $\n10.9\nbillion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our June 2022 stock repurchase program.\nDuring the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, we repurchased approximately\n41\nmillion shares of our common stock for approximately $\n4.2\nbillion at an average cost of $\n103.47\n. These shares were purchased in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in July 2018. As of December\u00a031, 2022, a total of approximately $\n861\nmillion and $\n15.0\nbillion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our July 2018 and June 2022 stock repurchase programs, respectively.\nShares of common stock repurchased for the periods presented were recorded as treasury stock for the purposes of calculating net income (loss) per share and were accounted for under the cost method.\nNo\nrepurchased shares of common stock have been retired.\nNOTE 15\u2014\nSTOCK-BASED AND EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\nEQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN\nUnder the terms of the Amended and Restated PayPal Holdings, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d), equity awards, including restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), restricted stock awards, performance based restricted stock units (\u201cPBRSUs\u201d), stock options, deferred stock units, and stock payments, may be granted to our directors, officers, and employees.\nIn May 2024, our stockholders approved the authorization of an additional\n20\nmillion shares to the Plan. At\u00a0December\u00a031, 2024,\u00a0approximately\n76\nmillion shares were authorized under the Plan and approximately\n46\nmillion\u00a0shares were available for future grant. Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises and the release of stock awards were funded primarily with the issuance of new shares of common stock.\n111\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nRSUs are granted to eligible employees under the Plan. RSUs issued prior to January 1, 2022 generally vest in equal annual installments over a period of\nthree years\n. RSUs issued on or after January 1, 2022 generally vest over\nthree years\nat a rate of\n33\n% after\none year\n, then in equal quarterly installments thereafter. RSUs are subject to an employee\u2019s continuing service to us, and do not have an expiration date. The cost of RSUs granted is determined using the fair market value of PayPal\u2019s common stock on the date of grant.\nCertain of our executives and non-executives are eligible to receive PBRSUs, which are equity awards that may be earned based upon the Company\u2019s performance relative to pre-established market or performance targets over performance periods of\none\nto\nthree years\n. We estimate the fair value of market-based PBRSU awards at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology that incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition might not be satisfied. The total estimated fair value is amortized over each award\u2019s performance period regardless of whether the condition is satisfied. The number of shares that vest at the end of each performance period will vary based on the performance against specified market conditions. PBRSUs that are subject to a performance condition may vest and settle depending on the Company\u2019s performance against pre-established performance metrics over a predefined performance period. PBRSUs with only a performance condition generally are  cliff vested following the completion of the performance period, subject to the Compensation Committee\u2019s approval of the level of achievement against the pre-established performance targets. Over the performance period, the number of PBRSUs with only a performance condition that may be issued, and related stock-based compensation expense that is recognized, is adjusted upward or downward based upon the probability of achieving the approved performance targets. Depending on the probability of achieving the pre-established performance targets, the number of PBRSUs with only a performance condition issued could range from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the target amount.\nAll stock options under the Plan were assumed in connection with acquisitions on the same terms and conditions (including vesting) applicable to such acquired companies\u2019 equity awards. The cost of stock options was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nEMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN\nUnder the terms of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d), shares of our common stock may be purchased over an offering period with a maximum duration of\ntwo years\nat\n85\n% of the lower of the fair market value on the first day of the applicable offering period or on the last business day of each\nsix-month\npurchase period within the offering period. Employees may contribute between\n2\n% and\n10\n% of their gross compensation during an offering period to purchase shares, but not more than the statutory limitation of $25,000 per year. All company stock purchased through the ESPP is considered outstanding and is included in the weighted-average outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted net income (loss) per share. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, our employees purchased\n2.1\nmillion,\n2.3\nmillion, and\n1.9\nmillion shares under the ESPP at an average per share price of $\n44.16\n, $\n55.34\n, and $\n73.20\n, respectively. As of\u00a0December\u00a031, 2024, approximately\n42\nmillion\u00a0shares were reserved for future issuance under the ESPP.\n112\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nRSU, PBRSU, AND RESTRICTED STOCK ACTIVITY\nThe following table summarizes RSU, PBRSU, and restricted stock activity under the Plan as of December\u00a031, 2024 and changes during the year ended December\u00a031, 2024:\nUnits\nWeighted Average Grant-Date\nFair Value\n(per share)\n(In\u00a0thousands,\u00a0except\u00a0per\u00a0share\u00a0amounts)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024\n30,164\n$\n88.10\nAwarded\nand assumed\n(1)\n24,138\n$\n63.49\nVested\n(1)\n(\n16,654\n)\n$\n92.40\nForfeited/cancelled\n(\n6,360\n)\n$\n85.96\nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n31,288\n$\n67.35\nExpected to vest\n26,244\n(1)\nIncludes approximately\n1.1\nmillion of additional PBRSUs issued during 2024 due to the achievement of company performance metrics on awards granted in previous years.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs and PBRSUs vested under the Plan was $\n1.1\nbillion, $\n752\nmillion, and $\n935\nmillion, respectively.\nIn the year ended December\u00a031, 2024, the Company granted\n1.9\nmillion PBRSUs with a\nthree-year\nperformance period.

Future unearned stock-based compensation will increase to the extent we grant additional equity awards, change the mix of equity awards we grant, or assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions.\nEMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\nUnder the terms of the PayPal Holdings, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, which also qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Code, participating U.S. employees may contribute up to\n50\n% of their eligible compensation, but not more than statutory limits. Under the PayPal plan, eligible employees received one dollar for each dollar contributed, up to\n4\n% of each employee\u2019s eligible salary, subject to a maximum employer contribution per employee of $\n13,800\nin 2024, $\n13,200\nin 2023, and $\n12,200\nin 2022. Our non-U.S. employees are covered by other savings plans. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the matching contribution expense for our U.S. and international savings plans was approximately $\n74\nmillion, $\n80\nmillion, and $\n83\nmillion, respectively.\nNOTE 16\u2014\nINCOME TAXES\nThe components of income before income taxes were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nUnited States\n$\n946\n$\n993\n$\n(\n155\n)\nInternational\n4,383\n4,418\n3,521\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n5,329\n$\n5,411\n$\n3,366\n114\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nThe income tax expense was composed of the following:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n342\n$\n1,031\n$\n688\nState and local\n107\n145\n104\nForeign\n502\n657\n966\nTotal current portion of income tax expense (benefit)\n$\n951\n$\n1,833\n$\n1,758\nDeferred:\nFederal\n$\n278\n$\n(\n490\n)\n$\n(\n563\n)\nState and local\n(\n29\n)\n(\n79\n)\n(\n101\n)\nForeign\n(\n18\n)\n(\n99\n)\n(\n147\n)\nTotal deferred portion of income tax expense (benefit)\n231\n(\n668\n)\n(\n811\n)\nIncome tax expense\n$\n1,182\n$\n1,165\n$\n947\nThe following is a reconciliation of the difference between the effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFederal statutory rate\n21.0\n%\n21.0\n%\n21.0\n%\nDomestic income taxed at different rates\n0.1\n%\n(\n1.5\n)\n%\n(\n0.6\n)\n%\nState taxes, net of federal benefit\n1.1\n%\n1.1\n%\n\u2014\n%\nForeign income taxed at different rates\n(\n4.3\n)\n%\n(\n5.1\n)\n%\n(\n12.2\n)\n%\nStock-based compensation expense\n2.6\n%\n3.5\n%\n4.1\n%\nTax credits\n0.6\n%\n(\n0.7\n)\n%\n(\n0.4\n)\n%\nChange in valuation allowances\n0.6\n%\n\u2014\n%\n2.2\n%\nIntra-group transfer of intellectual property\n\u2014\n%\n\u2014\n%\n10.0\n%\nOther\n0.5\n%\n3.2\n%\n4.0\n%\nEffective income tax rate\n22.2\n%\n21.5\n%\n28.1\n%\n115\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.\nSignificant deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss and credit carryforwards\n$\n265\n$\n305\nAccruals and allowances\n546\n761\nLease liabilities\n194\n138\nStock-based compensation\n93\n168\nNet unrealized losses\n1\n36\nSafeguarded crypto liabilities\n743\n319\nCapitalized research and development\n1,077\n1,207\nOther items\n89\n114\nTotal deferred tax assets\n3,008\n3,048\nValuation allowance\n(\n240\n)\n(\n276\n)\nNet deferred tax assets\n$\n2,768\n$\n2,772\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nROU lease assets\n$\n(\n153\n)\n$\n(\n96\n)\nCapitalized software development costs\n(\n176\n)\n(\n187\n)\nNet unrealized gains\n(\n97\n)\n(\n170\n)\nSafeguarded crypto assets\n(\n743\n)\n(\n319\n)\nOther items\n(\n101\n)\n(\n161\n)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(\n1,270\n)\n(\n933\n)\nNet deferred tax assets\n$\n1,498\n$\n1,839\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024, our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $\n733\nmillion, and certain of these amounts are subject to an annual limitation. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2025. It is more likely than not that most of these net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized; therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance against them. As of December\u00a031, 2024, our California research and development tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $\n270\nmillion, which may be carried forward indefinitely.\nRepatriation of our foreign earnings for use in the U.S. is generally not expected to result in a significant amount of income taxes; as a result, the corresponding deferred tax liability we have accrued is not material.\nWe benefit from agreements concluded in certain jurisdictions, most significantly Singapore. The Singapore agreement is effective through 2030, results in significantly lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and requires various thresholds of investment and employment in that jurisdiction. We review our compliance on an annual basis to ensure we continue to meet our obligations under this agreement. This agreement resulted in tax savings of approximately $\n473\nmillion, $\n441\nmillion, and $\n510\nmillion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Excluding the effect of U.S. and foreign tax legislation the benefit of this agreement on our net income (loss) per share (diluted) was approximately $\n0.46\n, $\n0.40\n, and $\n0.44\nin 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. These results may further vary based on our overall tax profile.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) has published model rules, which include the implementation of a global minimum tax rate of 15%, commonly referred to as Pillar Two. Certain countries in which we do business have enacted implementing legislation effective January 1, 2024. Based on the Company\u2019s analysis of such enacted legislation for jurisdictions in which we operate, there was not a material impact to the Company\u2019s 2024 income tax provision.\n116\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nThe following table reflects changes in unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented below:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nGross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits as of the beginning of the period\n$\n2,236\n$\n1,877\n$\n1,678\nIncreases related to prior period tax positions\n44\n178\n52\nDecreases related to prior period tax positions\n(\n201\n)\n(\n30\n)\n(\n185\n)\nIncreases related to current period tax positions\n280\n235\n337\nSettlements\n\u2014\n\u2014\n(\n2\n)\nStatute of limitation expirations\n(\n39\n)\n(\n24\n)\n(\n3\n)\nGross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits as of the end of the period\n$\n2,320\n$\n2,236\n$\n1,877\nIf the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $\n1.5\nbillion.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recognized net interest and penalties of $\n50\nmillion, $\n151\nmillion, and $\n119\nmillion, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. This expense is reflected in the \u201cOther\u201d line of our effective income tax rate schedule. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $\n556\nmillion and $\n520\nmillion, respectively.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by certain tax authorities for the 2013 to 2023 tax years. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to examination by tax authorities for tax years after 2012 primarily include the U.S. (Federal and California), India, Israel, and Singapore. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from our open examinations.\nDue to various factors, including uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of these unrecognized tax benefits is highly uncertain. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months, we may receive additional tax adjustments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of audits in one or more jurisdictions. These adjustments or settlements could result in changes to our unrecognized tax benefits related to positions on prior year tax filings. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we were unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn connection with our separation from eBay in 2015, we entered into various agreements that govern the relationship between the parties going forward, including a tax matters agreement. Under the tax matters agreement, eBay is generally responsible for all additional taxes (and will be entitled to all related refunds of taxes) imposed on eBay and its subsidiaries (including subsidiaries that were transferred to PayPal pursuant to the separation) arising after the separation date with respect to the taxable periods (or portions thereof) ended on or prior to July 17, 2015, except for those taxes for which PayPal has reflected an unrecognized tax benefit in its financial statements on the separation date.\n117\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\nNOTE 17\u2014\nRESTRUCTURING AND OTHER\nRESTRUCTURING\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to streamline operations, focus resources on core strategic priorities, and improve our cost structure.

The associated restructuring charges in 2023 were $\n122\nmillion. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, which were substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2023.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, management initiated a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce intended to streamline and optimize our global operations to enhance operating efficiency. This effort focused on reducing redundant operations and simplifying our organizational structure. The associated restructuring charges in 2022 were $\n121\nmillion. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, as well as associated consulting costs under this strategic reduction. The strategic actions associated with this plan were substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2022.\nWe continue to review our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We incurred asset impairment charges of\nnil\nin 2024 and $\n61\nmillion and $\n81\nmillion in 2023 and 2022, respectively, due to exiting certain leased properties, which resulted in a reduction of ROU lease assets and related leasehold improvements. Additionally, we recognized a gain of $\n17\nmillion due to the sale of an owned property and incurred a loss of $\n14\nmillion related to another owned property held for sale in the year ended December\u00a031, 2023.\nOTHER\nDuring the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, approximately $\n129\nmillion and $\n74\nmillion, respectively, of losses were recorded in restructuring and other, which included net loss on sale of loans and interest receivable previously held for sale (inclusive of transactions costs) and fair value adjustments to measure loans and interest receivable, held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of Happy Returns and recorded a pre-tax gain of $\n339\nmillion, net of transaction costs, in restructuring and other.
